Like its Hawaiian namesake the North Shore surf can get huge and currents can be treacherous. The plus side is the area is very consistent. Thurso East is the jewel in the North Shore's crown; the world-famous reef is one of Europe's finest waves, when it breaks. Unlike most of the N shore waves Thurso is quite fickle and has a limited swell window. The town itself is the only settlement of any size and the only place with full facilities. Going west the breaks are more exposed and spots like Brimms Ness hoover up any swell going.

Extensive, white sandy beaches face west out into the Atlantic, but Portugal's Cabo St Vincent creates a swell shadow, so deep low pressure systems on southerly trajectories are required to generate Andalusia's surf. These NW swells line up the best but there is potential for Antlantic hurricane swells and S to W swells from more local systems, although these are often accompanied by onshores. Andalucia is famous for windsurfing, thanks to the two gusty, generic wind directions - the winter levante from the east and the summer poniente from the west. These wind patterns occasionally shift, but the coastline has some very useful bends and twists, giving rise to clean waves on most winds. The surfing epicentre really starts in El Palmar and extends all the way down to Tarifa, where both the swell and the wind are strongest. Highlights include the cluster of Canos de Meca, a long left reefbreak, Hierbabuena, a good right and Barbate's rivermouth lefts. During the winter season a 3\/2mm full wetsuit is ample warmth for most, plus optional booties.\nWith over 3000 hours of sunshine per year and relatively calm local weather systems the swells during the winter are usually well organised, powerful and perfect.\n\n","coordinates":{"lat":36.23,"lon":-6.0716},"iso":"es"},{"_id":20,"_obj":"SurfArea","_path":"SurfArea","url":"\/Pais-Vasco-East-Surfing\/20\/","name":"Pais Vasco - East","countryId":9,"timezone":"Europe\/Madrid","whenToGo":null,"pluses":["Heavy tubing waves","Fabulous scenery","Easy access"],"minuses":["Lack of wave choice","Inconsistent","Windy and subject to tides"],"description":"Tucked into the corner of the bay of Biscay, Mundaka is a dream lefthand barrel and possibly the best rivermouth wave in the world. A scenic road leads to the pretty fishing village of Mundaka, located at the very end of an estuary, or ria. This Spanish Basque village is now a celebrated surfing spot and attracts wave riders from all over the world.\nA deep channel at the end of the Ria has helped to create a long triangular sandbank with the perfect angle for catching the NW swells. The more rain there's been, the stronger the rivermouth flow, which in turn improves the quality of the sandbar. Thicker, longer and heavier barrels will result when the swell hits 4-6ft, the wind is from the S and the tide is low incoming. Conditions such as this will create a long barrelling tube with rides of up to 150-200 meters. From the word go the wave sucks up hard, making for steep challenging take-offs straight into  a sick barrel section. The ensuing long, fast wall, allows a few turns if you are going close to warp speed. The final two sections of the wave can vary in quality depending on the sandbar, but frequently they offer hollow cylinders with less crowd pressure. These sections can be trickier with higher pockets and difficult to make sections. Getting out to the line-up is easy from the harbour steps and paddling out through the river flow that runs between the rocky cliffs and the take-off zone. This huge current of water can swiftly take you beyond the first peak and out to sea, making it difficult to hold position in the line up. If you get caught in the impact zone, ride the white water in and paddle back to the edge of the river, which will quickly deposit you back at the take-off zone. This is also the go when it's big, rather than trying to paddle back out around the shoulder. The bigger the tidal range, the harder the rip will be pulling on the outgoing tide, and the bigger the tubes will be on the incoming tide. When the tide hits that magic point, between low and mid, the line-up will always be packed with locals from the surrounding area or Bilbao, French Basques and various international travellers. For the visiting surfer, mid tide and rising may be a better option, as the line-up will be far less hectic. However, like any jewel, perfect Mundaka is not easy to come by. The days when the right tide, right wind, and a good sized NW swell all come together are few and far between. To get 4-6ft waves at Mundaka, the beaches open to maximum swell have to be around 10-12ft.","coordinates":{"lat":43.4089,"lon":-2.695},"iso":"es"},{"_id":21,"_obj":"SurfArea","_path":"SurfArea","url":"\/Lofoten-Surfing\/21\/","name":"Lofoten","countryId":75,"timezone":"Europe\/Oslo","whenToGo":null,"pluses":["Long empty pointbreaks","Midnight sun","Unrivalled arctic scenery","Friendly vibe"],"minuses":["Cold summer conditions","Short surfing season","Difficult coastal access","Super expensive"],"monthInfo":[{"title":"Jan","rating":0,"wetsuit":1,"waterTemperature":"5","unit":"C"},{"title":"Feb","rating":0,"wetsuit":1,"waterTemperature":"5","unit":"C"},{"title":"Mar","rating":0,"wetsuit":2,"waterTemperature":"6","unit":"C"},{"title":"Apr","rating":2,"wetsuit":2,"waterTemperature":"6","unit":"C"},{"title":"May","rating":2,"wetsuit":2,"waterTemperature":"7","unit":"C"},{"title":"Jun","rating":1,"wetsuit":2,"waterTemperature":"7","unit":"C"},{"title":"Jul","rating":1,"wetsuit":2,"waterTemperature":"10","unit":"C"},{"title":"Aug","rating":2,"wetsuit":2,"waterTemperature":"10","unit":"C"},{"title":"Sep","rating":2,"wetsuit":2,"waterTemperature":"9","unit":"C"},{"title":"Oct","rating":1,"wetsuit":2,"waterTemperature":"9","unit":"C"},{"title":"Nov","rating":0,"wetsuit":2,"waterTemperature":"7","unit":"C"},{"title":"Dec","rating":0,"wetsuit":2,"waterTemperature":"7","unit":"C"}],"description":"Lofoten has received lots of media coverage thanks to its novelty value as a surf location inside the Arctic Circle.

Low pressure systems spawned in Baffin Bay, wind up south of Greenland, before sending groundswells slamming into the Reykjanes peninsula, the first stop on the transatlantic swell highway. These swells can be giant and very powerful, building suddenly and they are often accompanied by raw winds and stormy conditions. The Reykjanes peninsula is covered in old lava flows, so most of the waves break over volcanic reef or basalt rocks, sharp substances that take their toll on booties (and bodies). One exception is the black sand beach at Sandvik, providing a rare beginners' spot, but it can often equal the ferocity of the reefbreaks when it's overhead. Thorli is another popular choice with a defined paddling channel and attracts the Reykjavik regulars to the south coast in N winds. The Snaefellsness peninsula to the NW of Reykjavik also picks up plenty of swell from the S-W with more beachbreak than the Reykjanes but mainly 4WD access trails and few documented, bona fide surf spots. Vik is the southernmost point on the island and attracts any hint of swell down a submarine canyon onto quality black sandbanks. Beyond is a wilderness of waves. \nTides exceed 5m and there are only a few spots that can handle all tide heights. Even the sole beachbreak at Sandvik struggles to break at high tide. \nWinter is the most consistent swell season with excellent waves regularly hitting all sides of the Reykjanes. The problem in mid-winter is getting the right conditions to conspire in the very short span of daylight. Strong winds, chilling temperatures, snowstorms and large tidal fluctuations are just some of the variables. September to November can be good months, with manageable air and water temperatures, and frequent low pressures. May-August sees plenty of summer flat spells in the southwest and could be a good time to explore the east and the north coasts for arctic windswells. It's impossible to talk about surfing in Iceland without talking rubber. Water temps bottom out around 3-4\u00baC requiring seriously thick 6mm rubber and 7mm boots and gloves. Late summer water can hit 12\u00baC so a 4\/3 and no gloves is do-able, but remember the windchill factor can have a big effect and the constant winds can often gust up to 100km\/h.\n","coordinates":{"lat":63.8588,"lon":-22.7002},"iso":"is"},{"_id":25,"_obj":"SurfArea","_path":"SurfArea","url":"\/Gran-Canaria-North-Surfing\/25\/","name":"Gran Canaria - North","countryId":20,"timezone":"Atlantic\/Canary","whenToGo":null,"pluses":[],"minuses":[],"monthInfo":[{"title":"Jan","rating":2},{"title":"Feb","rating":2},{"title":"Mar","rating":2},{"title":"Apr","rating":1},{"title":"May","rating":0},{"title":"Jun","rating":0},{"title":"Jul","rating":0},{"title":"Aug","rating":0},{"title":"Sep","rating":1},{"title":"Oct","rating":1},{"title":"Nov","rating":2},{"title":"Dec","rating":2}],"description":"Research by Siracusa University (EEUU) describes Las Palmas de Gran Canaria as the city with the best weather in the world and the island displays both sub tropical and arid landscapes that typify the island chain.

The continental shelf extends out into the Bay of Biscay and there is a bit of a N-NW swell shadow from Brittany, so the beachbreaks don't  quite have the power of the more famous spots further south. However, some interesting rocks and flat slab reefs can be found, particularly on the islands in the area. Proximity to some large cities ensures year-round crowds at the best spots, but this coastline is often overlooked by travelling surfers heading south. Spring to autumn for the beachbreaks until the winter swells and winds divert the focus to the island breaks and reefs that offer some protection.","coordinates":{"lat":46.0479,"lon":-1.4186},"iso":"fr"},{"_id":32,"_obj":"SurfArea","_path":"SurfArea","url":"\/Gironde-Surfing\/32\/","name":"Gironde","countryId":6,"timezone":"Europe\/Paris","whenToGo":null,"pluses":["Empty peaks to find\r\n","Uncrowded off-season","Mascaret novelty","Crazy summer parties","Excellent wines and oysters\r\n"],"minuses":["Beachbreaks only\r\n\r\n","Lack of epic spots","Summer crowds","Frequent onshores","Cold water in winter"],"monthInfo":[{"title":"Jan","rating":0,"wetsuit":4,"waterTemperature":"12","unit":"C"},{"title":"Feb","rating":0,"wetsuit":4,"waterTemperature":"12","unit":"C"},{"title":"Mar","rating":0,"wetsuit":4,"waterTemperature":"13","unit":"C"},{"title":"Apr","rating":1,"wetsuit":4,"waterTemperature":"13","unit":"C"},{"title":"May","rating":2,"wetsuit":5,"waterTemperature":"15","unit":"C"},{"title":"Jun","rating":2,"wetsuit":5,"waterTemperature":"15","unit":"C"},{"title":"Jul","rating":1,"wetsuit":null,"waterTemperature":"20","unit":"C"},{"title":"Aug","rating":1,"wetsuit":null,"waterTemperature":"20","unit":"C"},{"title":"Sep","rating":2,"wetsuit":5,"waterTemperature":"18","unit":"C"},{"title":"Oct","rating":2,"wetsuit":5,"waterTemperature":"18","unit":"C"},{"title":"Nov","rating":1,"wetsuit":4,"waterTemperature":"14","unit":"C"},{"title":"Dec","rating":1,"wetsuit":4,"waterTemperature":"14","unit":"C"}],"description":"The wide River Gironde divides the rocky coastline of northern France from the endless sands of Europe's longest beach to the south.

Known as the 'Fosse de Capbreton' this swell-focusing trench (or 'gouf') is the reason that Hossegor has forged a reputation for being one of the best beachbreaks on the planet. Up to 3m, Hossegor's beaches deliver exceptionally powerful, perfect peaks, often very close to shore and invariably hollow. When conditions conspire, spitting barrels can be spied far into the distance in either direction, spreading groups of surfers away from the main access points. On the downside, currents and longshore drift can be brutal, sandbars are constantly shifting, paddling-out channels are scarce at size, tidal ranges are large and wind protection is almost non-existent. However none of these factors have deterred the ever-growing crowds of riders and surf companies that call Hossegor home, helped by the fact that this corner of Europe's Atlantic coast has the warmest water temps, allowing up to 4 months of rubberless surfing.\nSouthern Landes is close to being a year-round destination, although big, cold beachbreaks at La Nord are not everyone's idea of fun.

The northwesterly aspect catches all available swell but the year-round northerly wind flow can blow it out easily. Highlights include the many possibilities along the coast road from El Jadida, through Oualidia and on to Safi, where the first classic, Moroccan righthand points begin. Safi's 'Garden' has been transformed from localised semi-secret spot into the government sponsored 'Surfing Park Sidi Bouzide'. The main highway heads inland from Safi and rejoins the coast in Essaouira, the famous hippie town that Jimi Hendrix tried to buy in the late '60s. The town is now favoured by windsurfers, because this area suffers from strong cross-shore winds, but there are a few waves around and a good beginners' beach as well. The coastline between Essaouira and Cap Rhir hides many quality reefs, points and beachbreaks, which receive more swell than further south, but also more wind. It's a wild stretch with poor roads leading into tiny fishing villages, although development has already come to Immesouane and the freecampers will soon have to share with the tourists when the new beachfront hotel is built. Although Tamri and Boilers are essentially part of the Taghazout scene, which is only half an hour's drive away, they still benefit from the far better swell exposure that the central coast enjoys. When Killers is struggling to break, Boilers is often head high and Tamri will be even bigger. There's more to find in this area for those willing to look around.\nCentral Morocco is a halfway house between the summery north and the wintery south. Any time from autumn to spring should provide the conditions to ride the headland-protected pointbreaks and get some exposed beach\/reef action.

Stretching for 600kms from Agadir to the disputed border with Western Sahara and then another 800kms down to Mauritania, this is a large, empty wilderness. Surfing locations are dictated by where the roads hit the coast at towns like Sidi Ifni, Tan Tan, Tarfaya and Dakhla. The coast faces due NW and has little problem picking up swell, but it really does suffer from strong, northerly trades, especially from spring to autumn. Morning offshores are a possibility but the land heats up so quickly there is only a couple of hours' window to surf before the sea breezes blow onshore. Sidi Ifni is in easy striking distance from Agadir and has some good waves, although pollution can destroy the experience. Down the 4x4 tracks to the south there are a few fickle points to be found but travelling times are long, roads and maps are often confusing and finding these breaks is a real mission. Things get even more difficult as the main road heads inland and trackless desert falsely promises to reveal the coast over the next rise. Also, long tranches of coast are sea cliffs and have no access to the sea. Not for the unprepared or faint-hearted. From the border of Western Sahara down to Dakhla, the road shadows the coast, but the Canary Isles effectively block most of the NW swell from this stretch. Dakhla has a range of reefs and beaches and is the most accessible surf along this desert coast.\nOnce again, winter is the go for many reasons.

Strong winds are part of the deal, making this island a world-renowned windsurfing spot, but there are plenty of waves to be found in the calmer winter months. The north coast is packed with exposed reefs that pick up all the swells from W round to E and the waves range in intensity from the challenging tubes of Lobos to the mellow walls of Derecha de los Alemanes. The long west coast offers open, rock-strewn beachbreak that is offshore in NE winds but anywhere south of Cotillo is isolated and currents can be extreme. The far south has a couple of quality set-ups waiting for the right conditions but it is a long drive down and the chance of getting skunked is high. The east coast is surfed up near Corralejo where bright white sands cover some nice little reefs and beginners can get some space but if the NE'er is blowing then the wind and kite rigs will be flying all over the place. Summer can get surprisingly big on the east coast and there is potential for exploration but it is usually onshore.\nThe depths of winter are going to be the best bet when the wind is lighter and more E than N. Early starts are advisable to beat the wind and the crowds, while siesta time matches the strongest wind period of the day.

It is the only island in the chain with north-facing beachbreaks at Ribeira Grande and probably has the greatest variety of surf spots. Both the western and eastern ends of S\u00e3o Miguel are very cliffy as the land drops away sharply from the volcanic peaks that used to be two separate islands. This means the centre of the island is lower and allows for the beaches to form on the north and south coasts. Big waves in heavy water situations characterise the north coasts of the Azores and S\u00e3o Miguel has its share, but few are surfed and many are at the base of cliffs and only accessible by boat \u00d0 Baixa de Viola being the exception. Rabo de Peixe now breaks inside the harbour wall that destroyed a better reef outside but it is still a focal point for winter swells thanks to ease of access and ride compared to the many unridden breaks visible from the cliffs. Mosteiros has the only regularly surfed breaks out west and nothing much happens on the SW coast until Ponta Delgada. Populo is just that, perfectly named as the city beach where everyone learns to surf. With a wide swell window and adaptable sandbanks, it gets especially good on summer S swells. The south coast has way more accessible breaks and fewer surfers riding them, all the way out to the heavy seawall breaks at Ribeira Quente. The east coast is a let down except for the rare challenging lefts of Faja do Araujo. This island is pretty flexible and should be considered a year-round destination with its mix of big swell reefs and exposed summer beachbreaks.\n","coordinates":{"lat":39.42,"lon":-31.26},"iso":"pt"},{"_id":57,"_obj":"SurfArea","_path":"SurfArea","url":"\/Sweden-Surfing\/57\/","name":"Sweden","countryId":200,"timezone":"Europe\/Stockholm","whenToGo":null,"pluses":[],"minuses":[],"monthInfo":[{"title":"Jan","rating":1,"wetsuit":1,"waterTemperature":"2","unit":"C"},{"title":"Feb","rating":1,"wetsuit":1,"waterTemperature":"2","unit":"C"},{"title":"Mar","rating":1,"wetsuit":1,"waterTemperature":"3","unit":"C"},{"title":"Apr","rating":2,"wetsuit":1,"waterTemperature":"3","unit":"C"},{"title":"May","rating":1,"wetsuit":2,"waterTemperature":"10","unit":"C"},{"title":"Jun","rating":0,"wetsuit":2,"waterTemperature":"10","unit":"C"},{"title":"Jul","rating":0,"wetsuit":5,"waterTemperature":"16","unit":"C"},{"title":"Aug","rating":1,"wetsuit":5,"waterTemperature":"16","unit":"C"},{"title":"Sep","rating":2,"wetsuit":4,"waterTemperature":"13","unit":"C"},{"title":"Oct","rating":2,"wetsuit":4,"waterTemperature":"13","unit":"C"},{"title":"Nov","rating":2,"wetsuit":2,"waterTemperature":"6","unit":"C"},{"title":"Dec","rating":1,"wetsuit":2,"waterTemperature":"6","unit":"C"}],"description":"","iso":"se"},{"_id":58,"_obj":"SurfArea","_path":"SurfArea","url":"\/All-Belgian-Spots-Surfing\/58\/","name":"All Belgian Spots","countryId":14,"timezone":"Europe\/Amsterdam","whenToGo":null,"pluses":[],"minuses":[],"description":"Belgium generally receives less swell than the Netherlands and the lack of depth offshore robs the swell of some power.

Perfectly situated to pick up the NW-N swells created by low pressure systems off Norway and also able to catch SW windswell, these two nations do have some surfable corners. Like Denmark and Germany, the key is whether the wind will co-operate and switch offshore after producing a swell, but there are many jetties to find some protection behind. Tides exceed 2m, which are magnified by the flat beach slope. Starting in the north of the Netherlands, Waddeneilanden are an arc of sandy barrier islands that face almost due north at the German border, before curving round to west-facing on Texel, the southern and most popular island. This aspect translates to maximum swell size and longevity, but the long, unstabilised beaches are swept by vicious currents and there are few people around to help. A boat would open up the potential for discovery. The northern beaches of the Netherlands are flat and unremarkable but a few key spots like Petten and Hargen work in SW and NW swells respectively. The huge harbour jetty at Nordpier is the focus for Amsterdam surfers, but the queen of the coast is undoubtedly Scheveningen where crowds flock to the choice of breaks around the incredibly long inlet jetties. Past the gargantuan Europoort are the shifty peaks of Maasvlakte where construction has destroyed the famed Maasexpress but there are still some good waves in N swells at Blokken and Slufter. Shallow, offshore sandbanks destroy the surf to the south, but things improve around Domburg in Zeeland.

While N-NW groundswells squeezing through the narrow gap between Scotland and Norway should produce the best surf for all, including the East Frisian (Ostfriesische Inseln) Islands, it is often the SW-W windswells that bring the most waves to Sylt (Nordfriesische). As with all the North Sea Nations, the key to good waves is strong onshore winds to build the swell then a brief period of cross or offshore winds before the short-fetch lines disappear. Timing is everything as good conditions can come and go in a matter of hours. Mid to high tides are favoured as they give more depth over the offshore shoals that filter and reduce the potential power of the swell. Over on the Baltic Sea side of Germany, constant strong winds from a variety of directions are needed to generate any kind of rideable wave and while it is popular with windsurfers, only the desperate and mad should apply to its occasionally ice covered waters. Tidal range is about 2.5m on Sylt and non-existent in the brackish Baltic.\n\nSylt is the epicentre of German surfing and the gently-curving, sandy, barrier island hosts 35kms of beachbreak from north to south. Much of it consists of open, unstabilised strands, although there are some small jetties and sand-covered boulders to help wave shape around Westerland. It's a big summer scene with beach-goers, many of whom try surfing, but waves are inconsistent and frustrated locals have to wait for better opportunities after the tourists have gone. Further south, there are more shifting sandbars at St Peter Ording, another big resort town on the mainland but better waves can usually be found on the East Frisian Islands of Norderney and Borkum. Norderney sits in the middle of the barrier island chain and picks up any swell with a bit of north in it including NE. Borkum sits at the border with the Netherlands and shares the same surf characteristics \u2013 shifting beachbreak peaks and big crowds during the summer vacation period. The Baltic breaks are for dedicated users only, who need thick skins and thicker wetsuits. Constant onshores from the NW for some of the breaks, otherwise strong, freezing E winds supply Damp and Pelzerhaken. There is also a bit of a spring to autumn river surfing scene in a few locations, centred on the standing wave in Munich.\n\nIdeally, the best surfing season is late summer to autumn when the water temperatures get up to 16\u00baC (locals claim it sometimes gets as high as 20\u00baC!) and a groundswell from a low pressure on the North Sea hits the islands. It is, however, all about the wind and the rare offshore days are scattered through the seasons. Summers can be very flat and in the wintertime the water temperature gets down to 2\u00baC and 0\u00baC in the Baltic, but there will still be surfers in the water.\n\n","coordinates":{"lat":54.9028,"lon":8.2928},"iso":"de"},{"_id":63,"_obj":"SurfArea","_path":"SurfArea","url":"\/Washington-Surfing\/63\/","name":"Washington","countryId":23,"timezone":"America\/Los_Angeles","whenToGo":null,"pluses":[],"minuses":[],"monthInfo":[{"title":"Jan","rating":1,"wetsuit":2,"waterTemperature":"7","unit":"C"},{"title":"Feb","rating":1,"wetsuit":2,"waterTemperature":"7","unit":"C"},{"title":"Mar","rating":0,"wetsuit":2,"waterTemperature":"9","unit":"C"},{"title":"Apr","rating":0,"wetsuit":2,"waterTemperature":"9","unit":"C"},{"title":"May","rating":0,"wetsuit":4,"waterTemperature":"11","unit":"C"},{"title":"Jun","rating":1,"wetsuit":4,"waterTemperature":"11","unit":"C"},{"title":"Jul","rating":1,"wetsuit":4,"waterTemperature":"12","unit":"C"},{"title":"Aug","rating":1,"wetsuit":4,"waterTemperature":"12","unit":"C"},{"title":"Sep","rating":2,"wetsuit":4,"waterTemperature":"11","unit":"C"},{"title":"Oct","rating":2,"wetsuit":4,"waterTemperature":"11","unit":"C"},{"title":"Nov","rating":2,"wetsuit":2,"waterTemperature":"9","unit":"C"},{"title":"Dec","rating":1,"wetsuit":2,"waterTemperature":"9","unit":"C"}],"description":"Access to much of Washington's coast is attained by side roads, primitive lanes, or trails. The situation is complicated by the state's relatively arcane property laws, which have privatized huge tracts of shoreline to as much as a quarter mile below the mean high tide line, and the fact that the lion's share of tribal reservation land has been set aside in the more remote regions of the state, and that includes the rugged, storm-wracked coasts. The ocean is cold here, although the Japan (or Kuroshio) current moderates conditions somewhat.\nToo far north to feel much in the way of Southern Hemi energy in the summer months (when the action is mostly windswell or weak area lows), during a typical winter, relentless storms bombard the Washington coast with huge swells, torrential rains, and wave-mangling S winds. There aren't  too many places to hide, which is why many a Washington surfer seeks solace in the Strait of Juan de Fuca, in the windshadow of the Olympics and shoreline bluffs. The problem here is access. While there are a few highly regarded surf spots, entry is through tribal or private lands, and past indiscretions have generally made surfers personae non gratae.\nOut on the coast, there are really only a couple of accessible, sheltered winter spots, and one of them (Westport) is the closest thing in the state to Surf City. Here, in the shelter of the jetty at the entrance to Grays Harbor, it's possible to enjoy clean swells, manicured by S winds that can whip the place into offshore perfection due to the E-W angle of the beach in this rare surf sanctuary.\nOn the north side of the Grays Harbor inlet is Ocean Shores, a seaside town with even less to offer surfers than Westport. However, the jetty at the north entrance to Grays Harbor creates a rare S wind block while leaving the way open to W and N swells. North of Ocean Shores, it's over 20 miles (32km) of sand and beachbreak until you get to Washington's lost treasure, Point Grenville. An anomaly on an otherwise almost pointless coast, Grenville is a big headland that hooks out into the Pacific, sheltering a large scoop of bay under its southern flank. Located within the lands of Quinault Indian Nation, Grenville was once Washington's version of Malibu, back in the first boom era of the early 1960s. Not that Grenville shows any similarity to Malibu in wave quality \u2013 this is not a classic, peeling point wave. But the rocky promontory interrupts the relentless NW winds and creates an eddy of atmospheric tranquility on this heavily thrashed coast. Depending on tide, there might be a half dozen spots working over a 2-mile (3.2km) stretch of glorious natural terrain. But the free-and-easy access of those days was lost. 'Kids painting graffiti, trash, parties \u2013 it all added up to the demise of a great family beach,' says Tom LeCompte, a veteran of those years, now a teacher up in Ketchikan, Alaska.\nFrom Westport, it's mostly beachbreak south almost to the Columbia River. Not a lot of character \u2013 big beaches and nondescript sandbars open to the alternating surges of N and S winds, with only the occasional glassy or E wind day to set up some surfable peaks.\n","coordinates":{"lat":46.9009,"lon":-124.137},"iso":"us"},{"_id":64,"_obj":"SurfArea","_path":"SurfArea","url":"\/North-Surfing\/64\/","name":"North","countryId":24,"timezone":"America\/Los_Angeles","whenToGo":null,"pluses":["Powerful consistent swells","Seaside point","Beautiful scenery","Spot variety"],"minuses":["Swells often too big","Stormy climate","Cold water","Localism and sharks"],"monthInfo":[{"title":"Jan","rating":1,"wetsuit":4,"waterTemperature":"12","unit":"C"},{"title":"Feb","rating":1,"wetsuit":4,"waterTemperature":"12","unit":"C"},{"title":"Mar","rating":2,"wetsuit":4,"waterTemperature":"13","unit":"C"},{"title":"Apr","rating":1,"wetsuit":4,"waterTemperature":"13","unit":"C"},{"title":"May","rating":1,"wetsuit":4,"waterTemperature":"13","unit":"C"},{"title":"Jun","rating":0,"wetsuit":4,"waterTemperature":"13","unit":"C"},{"title":"Jul","rating":0,"wetsuit":4,"waterTemperature":"14","unit":"C"},{"title":"Aug","rating":0,"wetsuit":4,"waterTemperature":"14","unit":"C"},{"title":"Sep","rating":1,"wetsuit":4,"waterTemperature":"14","unit":"C"},{"title":"Oct","rating":2,"wetsuit":4,"waterTemperature":"14","unit":"C"},{"title":"Nov","rating":2,"wetsuit":4,"waterTemperature":"13","unit":"C"},{"title":"Dec","rating":1,"wetsuit":4,"waterTemperature":"13","unit":"C"}],"description":"North Oregon gets great surf when the conditions align, which unfortunately isn't very often. It is a rugged land of natural wonder with a decent variety of surf spots, each requiring specific conditions to turn on. Lack of swell is never a problem, though it can be an issue during the wintertime, when every spot is maxed out. Wind is the critical factor for finding good waves in Oregon and fortunately, the north coast provides some protection either side of the major protruding points, capes and headlands. Some spots are crowded and well known, while others are empty and rarely spoken of. Wetsuit technology has increased the surfing population, most of whom are friendly. Surfing in Oregon has been happening for decades, despite the frigid water and sharks. The city of Seaside, Oregon's first coastal resort, is home to the famous Seaside Point, reputed to be the best wave in the Pacific Northwest and the best lefthand pointbreak in North America.","coordinates":{"lat":45.8863,"lon":-123.971},"iso":"us"},{"_id":65,"_obj":"SurfArea","_path":"SurfArea","url":"\/Central-North-Surfing\/65\/","name":"Central North","countryId":24,"timezone":"America\/Los_Angeles","whenToGo":null,"pluses":[],"minuses":[],"monthInfo":[{"title":"Jan","rating":1,"wetsuit":2,"waterTemperature":"9","unit":"C"},{"title":"Feb","rating":1,"wetsuit":2,"waterTemperature":"9","unit":"C"},{"title":"Mar","rating":2,"wetsuit":2,"waterTemperature":"10","unit":"C"},{"title":"Apr","rating":1,"wetsuit":2,"waterTemperature":"10","unit":"C"},{"title":"May","rating":1,"wetsuit":4,"waterTemperature":"12","unit":"C"},{"title":"Jun","rating":0,"wetsuit":4,"waterTemperature":"12","unit":"C"},{"title":"Jul","rating":0,"wetsuit":4,"waterTemperature":"13","unit":"C"},{"title":"Aug","rating":0,"wetsuit":4,"waterTemperature":"13","unit":"C"},{"title":"Sep","rating":1,"wetsuit":4,"waterTemperature":"12","unit":"C"},{"title":"Oct","rating":2,"wetsuit":4,"waterTemperature":"12","unit":"C"},{"title":"Nov","rating":2,"wetsuit":4,"waterTemperature":"11","unit":"C"},{"title":"Dec","rating":1,"wetsuit":4,"waterTemperature":"11","unit":"C"}],"description":"Near the mouth of the Columbia River, Highway 101 connects the historic town of Astoria with the broad, sandy beaches of northern Oregon. Nondescript and windblown, the only place you're  likely to find another surfer up here is during the summertime in the southern lee of rivermouth's south jetty. However, 15 miles (24km) down south is the bustling tourist burg of Seaside, tucked into the northern hook of Tillamook Head. The lefts that wrap around the north side of that promontory on a W or SW swell can be some of the best on the West Coast. From here to the California border, Highway 101 stays close to the coast, alternately maintaining a polite distance to avoid the shifting sands of the broad dunes then swinging close in to the undulating curves of projecting headlands (or sometimes sweeping discretely behind them). The scale of the place is immense, and the number of surfable peaks (the lion's share of it beachbreak) uncountable. But, as is the reality on this planet, the truly good spots are few and far between.\nThe northern coast of the state is punctuated with large headlands, beginning with Tillamook and then Capes Falcon, Meares, Kiwanda and Lookout, then Neskowin and Cascade Head. Things smooth out a little after that, through the surf hub of Lincoln City, with its surrounding reefs and beachbreaks down through some lovely coastal geography past Boiler Bay, Otter Rock and the big beach at Agate at Yaquina Head (both great learning spots), then slim-pickin's through the central coast from Waldport to the great dunes from Florence to Reedsport and on down to Coos Bay (the North Pole of the southern Oregon surf scene) and the big headland at Cape Arago. South of there \u2013 from Bandon out to Cape Blanco and Port Orford on down to Gold Beach is a little more varied and esoteric. From Gold Beach past Cape Sebastian to Brookings (the South Pole) and the border is hit or miss, but you can get lucky.\nConditions vary widely along this long and winding road, but for every rare, crowded spot you come upon, there are miles and miles and more miles of deserted surf \u2013 usually funky, but not always. Many swells that will hit California from the NW come straight out of the W to ramp up off Oregon's beaches, which means excellent swell exposure even at spots that are shielded from N or S winds. Like Washington State, a fair number of Oregon's most reliable waves are the result of man-made structures, mostly the series of rivermouth jetties that begins at the Columbia and ends with the Chetco in Brookings. With most of these situations you can expect wind protection during favored storm cycles. For instance, on winter NW swells accompanied (usually) by S winds, the north side of a jetty will be optimum; on summer S or SW swells accompanied by prevailing NW winds, the south side of a jetty will be the spot. The numerous headlands along this coast comport themselves in a similar fashion.\nThe nutrient-rich waters off the Oregon coast play host to the full food chain, and any Oregon surf shop worth its salt displays a local board that has been allegedly chomped by a Great White shark. In fact, only 16 unprovoked shark attacks have been recorded in Oregon since 1620, so it's not all that big a deal. However, compared to Florida and California, there are few surfers here, so when there is an attack, it seems a bit closer to home. At least two surfers have been the subject of shark attacks in the last 25 years, but nobody's been seriously tormented. In August of 1976, a white attacked a guy who was surfing the South Jetty at Winchester Bay (Umpqua River mouth), then in September of 1994, another surfer was attacked at Short Sand Beach in Oswald West State Park, near Seaside. Both attacks occurred in small, clean swell conditions and involved big fish \u2013 12-15ft. \u2013 but neither was a proper attack on a surfer, since both bites were inflicted on their boards. Perhaps word will get around among these predators that foam and fiberglass make a nasty nibble.\n","coordinates":{"lat":44.9539,"lon":-124.025},"iso":"us"},{"_id":66,"_obj":"SurfArea","_path":"SurfArea","url":"\/All-Danish-Spots-Surfing\/66\/","name":"All Danish Spots","countryId":15,"timezone":"Europe\/Copenhagen","whenToGo":null,"pluses":[],"minuses":[],"monthInfo":[{"title":"Jan","rating":2,"wetsuit":1,"waterTemperature":"5","unit":"C"},{"title":"Feb","rating":1,"wetsuit":1,"waterTemperature":"5","unit":"C"},{"title":"Mar","rating":2,"wetsuit":1,"waterTemperature":"6","unit":"C"},{"title":"Apr","rating":2,"wetsuit":1,"waterTemperature":"6","unit":"C"},{"title":"May","rating":1,"wetsuit":4,"waterTemperature":"12","unit":"C"},{"title":"Jun","rating":0,"wetsuit":4,"waterTemperature":"12","unit":"C"},{"title":"Jul","rating":0,"wetsuit":5,"waterTemperature":"16","unit":"C"},{"title":"Aug","rating":0,"wetsuit":5,"waterTemperature":"16","unit":"C"},{"title":"Sep","rating":1,"wetsuit":5,"waterTemperature":"15","unit":"C"},{"title":"Oct","rating":2,"wetsuit":5,"waterTemperature":"15","unit":"C"},{"title":"Nov","rating":2,"wetsuit":2,"waterTemperature":"9","unit":"C"},{"title":"Dec","rating":2,"wetsuit":2,"waterTemperature":"9","unit":"C"}],"description":"Although small, Denmark is surrounded by three different bodies of water, which divide up the surf zones. The North Sea is the main surf producer and the west coast of Jutland is battered by fierce westerly winds all year-round. These winds, especially when they come from the SW, can throw up some head high waves in half a day, while the coastline of small bays and long, rock groynes help clean up the surf nicely. The best conditions occur when a heavy depression is spinning somewhere to the northwest between Norway and Scotland, sending swell lines up to 6ft, hopefully coinciding with calm weather or E winds. These heavenly days are far outnumbered by messy onshore ones and all swells come and go quickly. The Kattegat requires really strong onshore winds from the northerly quadrant to get any rideable action, while the few Baltic spots are even less reliable and need E winds. Spring tides are double the average, hitting 2m near the German border, decreasing to 0.3m at Skagen in the Kattegat. Storm surges are often greater than the tidal range. The Baltic is micro-tidal and barely moves.\n\nThe best area is the stretch from Klitm\u00f8ller to Agger, with the popular Nr. Vorup\u00f8r situated in the middle. Good windswell can be ridden in breezes from S to NE and the coast is well exposed to occasional groundswells from the SW to NW. It is all beachbreaks except for the mussel covered reef in Klitm\u00f8ller. Exploring the miles of deserted beaches south of Agger, all the way to Hvide Sande is best done when winds are from an easterly direction. It's less consistent than the Klitm\u00f8ller area and the straight coastline is more exposed, with fewer harbour walls and jetties for protection from the wind, but with a good swell and clean conditions the beachbreaks can be punchy and semi-hollow. The Kattegat is the closest place to surf from Copenhagen but the waves are pretty pathetic. It takes at least 6 hours of 15m\/s W or NW winds to kick up some waves to ride between Gilleleje and Aalsgaarde on Zealand's north coast, while Hundested and Liseleje need N\/NE. More spots are found on Jutland's east coast north of Ebeltoft, needing very strong Kattegat winds between N and E. The Baltic Sea is surfed around Stevns Klint and R\u00f8dvig. Stevns breaks on a moderate onshore E or SE wind and R\u00f8dvig needs a stronger E to blow for at least 8 hours. Other areas with potential include Moen to the south, but the best Danish Baltic waves are on the island of Bornholm. Countless points and bays facing many different directions with a long fetch from the NE-E makes every windy day surfable. Bona fide surf info about the island is scarce, but rumours say that it gets as good as the west coast of Jutland. \nMost swells occur from September to April with the prime autumn months of September to November bringing the best waves to the west coast. Winter brings cold, near 4\u00baC water and short daylight hours, but more 6\/4 clad surfers are braving the conditions to score the stronger waves. Summer can be really good, depending on the wind patterns and a 3\/2 works in the warmest months. Swells are fewer, but the W wind will often provide good rideable windchop. The Kattegat works mainly in autumn northerlies, but wet summers can also bring many messy W wind days. Spring is often a good time for strong E winds in the Baltic, after the ice has gone.\n\n","coordinates":{"lat":57.0449,"lon":8.4869},"iso":"dk"},{"_id":67,"_obj":"SurfArea","_path":"SurfArea","url":"\/San-Francisco-County-Surfing\/67\/","name":"San Francisco County","countryId":22,"timezone":"America\/Los_Angeles","whenToGo":null,"pluses":["High swell consistency","Big wave spots","Great city attractions","Entertainment and nightlife"],"minuses":["Cold water","Urban crowds","Shark factor","Lack of sunshine"],"monthInfo":[{"title":"Jan","rating":1,"wetsuit":4,"waterTemperature":"12","unit":"C"},{"title":"Feb","rating":1,"wetsuit":4,"waterTemperature":"12","unit":"C"},{"title":"Mar","rating":2,"wetsuit":4,"waterTemperature":"13","unit":"C"},{"title":"Apr","rating":1,"wetsuit":4,"waterTemperature":"13","unit":"C"},{"title":"May","rating":1,"wetsuit":4,"waterTemperature":"13","unit":"C"},{"title":"Jun","rating":0,"wetsuit":4,"waterTemperature":"13","unit":"C"},{"title":"Jul","rating":0,"wetsuit":4,"waterTemperature":"14","unit":"C"},{"title":"Aug","rating":0,"wetsuit":4,"waterTemperature":"14","unit":"C"},{"title":"Sep","rating":1,"wetsuit":4,"waterTemperature":"14","unit":"C"},{"title":"Oct","rating":2,"wetsuit":4,"waterTemperature":"14","unit":"C"},{"title":"Nov","rating":2,"wetsuit":4,"waterTemperature":"13","unit":"C"},{"title":"Dec","rating":1,"wetsuit":4,"waterTemperature":"13","unit":"C"}],"description":"Despite being one of the world's best-loved tourist destinations, San Francisco is often overlooked by traveling surfers, who focus on the warmer water of Southern California or the numerous pointbreaks of 'Surf City USA', namely Santa Cruz.

And when it's working, Moss serves up world-class beachbreak barrels can be cold water rivals to Hossegor and Puerto Escondido.\nDown around the Monterey Peninsula itself are a bunch of quirky and fickle reefs, a point or two, some rocky beachbreak, and some booming sandbar spots \u2013 all breaking on different swell and wind directions. It's quite possible you could live an entire year in Monterey County and surf nowhere but the Peninsula. You'd  get some good days and some bad ones, but it's almost always possible to find some spot blowing offshore with a wave to ride.\nBig Sur is another story. Without fail, one glance at a topographic map of this section of the California coast sparks incoherent blather from the unenlightened surf-trekker who's intent on raiding this rocky maze because, dude, anywhere with that much serrated coastline must offer barrel after sparkling barrel. Not so. This coast's highly-venerated rugged beauty has been celebrated in stacks of coffee-table books. A legendary tourist destination and romantic escape, where a twisting, treacherous stretch of Highway 1 runs along the rims of sheer cliffs, it's a lovers' wonderland, but a hoodwinker for surfers the world over. Yeah, it's true. Despite the recurring lure of protected coves, bulbous headlands, white sand beachbreaks, and auspicious point set-ups, the 72 miles (115km) of photogenic shore from Carmel Highlands down to Ragged Point hold, at best, maybe a half-dozen funky surf spots. Big Sur's handful of spots is brutally fickle, rendered almost impossible to score epic unless you reside in the region. This is surf turf where local knowledge really comes into play.\nThe mouth of the Big Sur River (in Andrew Molera State Park) is the northern focal point of Big Sur surfing. A fairly long walk in tends to keep the crowd down, and the spot blows offshore on a prevailing NW wind, which whips around the headland, shooting directly into the oncoming waves \u2013 sometimes so fiercely it won't  let you make the drop. Elsewhere, ample big swell, ample bad wind, and sharp, sheer terrain are the reality. Highway 1 through Big Sur is periodically closed during the winter due to natural calamities like floods and slides, the latter sometimes precipitated by earthquakes in this less-than-stable geology (the infamous San Andreas Fault passes through the coastal range). The sights and sounds of a gray, messy ocean are impressive here, but the surfing is not. \n","coordinates":{"lat":36.5548,"lon":-121.932},"iso":"us"},{"_id":73,"_obj":"SurfArea","_path":"SurfArea","url":"\/San-Luis-Obispo-North-Surfing\/73\/","name":"San Luis Obispo - North","countryId":17,"timezone":"America\/Los_Angeles","whenToGo":null,"pluses":[],"minuses":[],"monthInfo":[{"title":"Jan","rating":1,"wetsuit":4,"waterTemperature":"12","unit":"C"},{"title":"Feb","rating":1,"wetsuit":4,"waterTemperature":"12","unit":"C"},{"title":"Mar","rating":1,"wetsuit":4,"waterTemperature":"12","unit":"C"},{"title":"Apr","rating":1,"wetsuit":4,"waterTemperature":"12","unit":"C"},{"title":"May","rating":0,"wetsuit":4,"waterTemperature":"13","unit":"C"},{"title":"Jun","rating":0,"wetsuit":4,"waterTemperature":"13","unit":"C"},{"title":"Jul","rating":0,"wetsuit":4,"waterTemperature":"14","unit":"C"},{"title":"Aug","rating":1,"wetsuit":4,"waterTemperature":"14","unit":"C"},{"title":"Sep","rating":1,"wetsuit":4,"waterTemperature":"14","unit":"C"},{"title":"Oct","rating":2,"wetsuit":4,"waterTemperature":"14","unit":"C"},{"title":"Nov","rating":2,"wetsuit":4,"waterTemperature":"13","unit":"C"},{"title":"Dec","rating":1,"wetsuit":4,"waterTemperature":"13","unit":"C"}],"description":"Kicked-back San Luis Obispo County (or 'SLO' for short) is better recognized for its esteemed California Polytechnic State University and opulent nearby Hearst Castle than for its surf.

Sometimes, however, due to the high coastal cliffs, the wind can actually wrap around the whole island, which will blow just about every spot out and make for a frustrating day of driving.\nThe most consistent spots on the island are Ponta Pequena and Paul do Mar on the southwest shore, and Faja da Areia on the north shore. Small swell or strong wind conditions often dictate that only one spot on the island will be working, which can become problematic on weekends when everyone is in the water. Conversely, when a big swell hits and lots of breaks are firing, it can be hard to find someone to surf with on weekdays. Every surf spot on Madeira is powerful and dangerous. There are no beachbreaks and gentler east coast waves like Machico break over rocks, which explains why there are still not many local surfers. Faja da Areia is generally regarded as the best place to learn on the island, and hence is also the most crowded. Despite being the 'beginner spot' , it's still a steep, ledgy wave that can pound the snot out of anyone. Welcome to Madeira! On the neighbouring island of Porto Santo, a craggy, unpromising north coast gives way to a very long, south-facing beachbreak that occasionally offers beginner peaks in NE-SW windswells.\nThe surf season runs from October through March with November to February considered as the prime months. Summers are generally flat, with few breaks able to make much of locally generated windswells on the east coast or Atlantic hurricane swells that tend to sweep further north. Unlike the Azores, Madeira is shadowed by Africa for any long-range southern hemi swells.\n","coordinates":{"lat":32.7373,"lon":-17.2132},"iso":"pt"},{"_id":84,"_obj":"SurfArea","_path":"SurfArea","url":"\/Cantabria-East-Surfing\/84\/","name":"Cantabria - East","countryId":9,"timezone":"Europe\/Madrid","whenToGo":null,"pluses":[],"minuses":[],"monthInfo":[{"title":"Jan","rating":0,"wetsuit":4,"waterTemperature":"12","unit":"C"},{"title":"Feb","rating":0,"wetsuit":4,"waterTemperature":"12","unit":"C"},{"title":"Mar","rating":1,"wetsuit":4,"waterTemperature":"13","unit":"C"},{"title":"Apr","rating":2,"wetsuit":4,"waterTemperature":"13","unit":"C"},{"title":"May","rating":2,"wetsuit":5,"waterTemperature":"15","unit":"C"},{"title":"Jun","rating":1,"wetsuit":5,"waterTemperature":"15","unit":"C"},{"title":"Jul","rating":1,"wetsuit":5,"waterTemperature":"19","unit":"C"},{"title":"Aug","rating":1,"wetsuit":5,"waterTemperature":"19","unit":"C"},{"title":"Sep","rating":2,"wetsuit":5,"waterTemperature":"17","unit":"C"},{"title":"Oct","rating":2,"wetsuit":5,"waterTemperature":"17","unit":"C"},{"title":"Nov","rating":1,"wetsuit":4,"waterTemperature":"14","unit":"C"},{"title":"Dec","rating":0,"wetsuit":4,"waterTemperature":"14","unit":"C"}],"description":"The coastal geology of Cantabria is slightly less abrupt than that of the Basque coast, so it has a multitude of good beachbreaks but a smaller number of good reefs.

The road south to Loop Head passes the booming rights at Spanish Point and the only other notable beaches around Doonbeg, where protection from SW winds make it an asset on this exposed coastline. Summer can be prime, especially if a high pressure establishes in the vicinity but unstable weather patterns make Clare hard to call.

This super consistent stretch of coast grabs the maximum from any swell direction and provides a wide range of wave breaking surfaces from gentle beaches and rivermouths to sheer slab reefs. Minho province shares many characteristics with its northern Spanish neighbour, Galicia, - lots of hills, lots of greenery and lots and lots of rain. Porto is the capital of Douro province, where it isn't  quite as wet, but the bleak industrial landscape combines with the weather to help deter visiting surfers. However it's the pollution around Porto that might be the biggest turn off in north Portugal. It gets so dirty that the local authorities sometimes put a ban on people entering the sea at all!\nThe best time for a surf trip around here is late spring through to autumn. The north winds that plague much of the country don't  seem to be as bad here.\nThe Minho river demarcates the border with Spain and sometimes provides hollow rights at its mouth. The average quality and consistency beachbreak peaks of Moledo do Minho are adjacent to sand-covered reefs that can turn perfect at lower tides, but get crowded. The southern end of Vila Praia de \u00c2ncora offers a much more consistent beachbreak in NW swells and is usually quieter. The serious surf starts in Afife with a high quality beachbreak often likened to Supertubos, but without the crowds. It's consistent, very fast, hollow and prefers a SW swell with a low to mid tide. Viana do Castelo, home of the Portuguese branch of Surfrider Foundation, hides a beautiful beach S of town called Cabadelo. Take a ferry or drive around to access the quite inconsistent but large righthander breaking off the river jetty that offers some N wind protection. If it's too small, drive 30km (19mi) south to the very consistent west-facing beachbreak just north of Esposende. It won't handle much size, the water is very cold but crowds are minimal. Check Agu\u00e7adoura for an endless beach with numerous quality peaks, the water here is super clean but it gets out of control when big. 5km (3mi) offshore float the Pelamis sea snakes that use the energy of waves to generate electricity. Experts should try the quality reefbreak left at P\u00f2voa do Varzim; it's short, sharp, shallow and full of open barrels in a SW swell. The neighbouring town of Vila do Conde is a popular place for the people of Porto. Near a bunch of rocks on the town centre beach, breaks a short, hollow punchy lefthander that can get busy due to its reliability. On the other side of the river, Azurara delivers mediocre but consistent beach peaks with better wind protection and a good shorebreak for bodyboarding. It's the first spot north of Porto with genuinely clean water. Similar waves can be found in Perafita, but the background is much more industrial and the rocks surrounding the beach are even hot to the touch! There are plenty of barrels in Le\u00e7a over highly consistent sandbars but few takers thanks to ridiculous pollution levels. In case of a massive swell, head to Matosinhos on the south side of the port and north of the rivermouth. The breakwater is a real swell filter here, but lifeguards red flag the beach when pollution levels are high (all the time), though many locals ignore the ban. The same extreme pollution affects all the breaks to the south including Luz, where the sandbars deliver semi-sheltered waves and the rare but epic rivermouth rights of Barra do Porto. Miramar can be excellent thanks to a high quality righthander that breaks over the reef near the offshore island. It's fickle, but fast and hollow with potential barrels in a solid NW swell. Espinho is the best spot in north Portugal despite the pollution, localism and heavy crowds. The jetty of this dilapidated city holds a long, consistent tubey right with good protection from the 'nortada' winds. Watch out for the inside section that closes-out over shallow rocks.\n","coordinates":{"lat":41.4291,"lon":-8.7868},"iso":"pt"},{"_id":105,"_obj":"SurfArea","_path":"SurfArea","url":"\/Beira-Litoral-Surfing\/105\/","name":"Beira Litoral","countryId":10,"timezone":"Europe\/Lisbon","whenToGo":null,"pluses":[],"minuses":[],"monthInfo":[{"title":"Jan","rating":0,"wetsuit":4,"waterTemperature":"12","unit":"C"},{"title":"Feb","rating":0,"wetsuit":4,"waterTemperature":"12","unit":"C"},{"title":"Mar","rating":1,"wetsuit":4,"waterTemperature":"13","unit":"C"},{"title":"Apr","rating":1,"wetsuit":4,"waterTemperature":"13","unit":"C"},{"title":"May","rating":2,"wetsuit":4,"waterTemperature":"15","unit":"C"},{"title":"Jun","rating":1,"wetsuit":4,"waterTemperature":"15","unit":"C"},{"title":"Jul","rating":1,"wetsuit":5,"waterTemperature":"18","unit":"C"},{"title":"Aug","rating":1,"wetsuit":5,"waterTemperature":"18","unit":"C"},{"title":"Sep","rating":2,"wetsuit":5,"waterTemperature":"17","unit":"C"},{"title":"Oct","rating":2,"wetsuit":5,"waterTemperature":"17","unit":"C"},{"title":"Nov","rating":1,"wetsuit":4,"waterTemperature":"14","unit":"C"},{"title":"Dec","rating":0,"wetsuit":4,"waterTemperature":"14","unit":"C"}],"description":"While the Beira Litoral coast gives the impression that this stretch is one of featureless wind and swell exposed beach break, there is more than initially meets the eye.

The Sierra Madre mountain range runs parallel to the Pacific with over thirty volcanoes and many peaks rising above 4,000m (13,100ft). But despite two-thirds of the country being mountainous and volcanic, not a single rock can be spotted along the 250km (156mi) coastline, making for a continuous stretch of mostly black-sand beachbreaks, only interrupted by the occasional rivermouth. This is the main reason why travelling surfers predominantly consider Guatemala as a transit zone between the more challenging breaks of Mexico to the north and the clean pointbreaks of El Salvador to the south.

Most of the reefs are sharp and the very clear water makes it hard to figure out exactly how deep it is. The water is actually the coldest equatorial water on earth, due to the Humboldt Current working its way up the coastline of South America and past the islands, bringing with it water from Antarctica.

In the Southern Hemisphere winter the waves around Punta Hermosa are typically big mushy rights with a lack of shape that can be ideal for longboarding.

North of the capital, Santiago, the landscape quickly changes to that of the Atacama, the driest desert in the world. The Pan American highway skirts the edge of the Atacama and can be used to reveal some of the treasures of the desert: perfect reef breaks. Arica and Iquique are two cities in the Atacama, 400km (250mi) apart and both are the home of great waves. Most of the waves along this coastline break close to the shore as cylindrical barrels slamming down hard onto shallow reefs full of urchins. It's often big and gnarly and many of the spots are more suitable for bodyboarders or the most skilled of surfers. Fortunately, there are channels, which enable safe paddle outs to most line-ups. The city of Arica is located on the magic Alacran peninsula, which is packed with classic spots.

Most of the reefs lie within 200m of the shore and offer powerful waves on offshore days, whilst the beaches are better surfed on the more common onshore days. The main centre is Recife, a place that used to be a good base for surfers, but all this has changed. Following the construction of a huge harbour in Boca de Suape in the early 90's, along with irresponsible coastal development and some serious over-fishing, the local eco-system experienced major changes. These changes were graphically illustrated at the top of the food chain where sharks began to go hungry and unsurprisingly, shark attacks on surfers increased dramatically. In the space of a few years there were six fatal attacks. The authorities, worried about dropping tourist numbers, responded by placing the blame squarely on the shoulders of surfers and banned surfing along a 60km (37mi) stretch of coast! Since1998 the beaches where surfing has been prohibited include the following:  \nOlinda, one of the most picturesque colonial towns in the country; Praia del Chifre, Recife; the resort area of Boa Viagem including the quality Acaiaca reefs; the hollow reef breaks of Abreus; the reefs of Quebra Mar; the reliable SE facing beach breaks of Paiva and finally Pedra Preta.

Like Hawaii, the island is the summit of a huge underwater volcano, rising 4.3km (2.7mi) from the ocean floor. The surrounding deep water and lack of continental shelf allows the swells to hit with unimpeded speed and power. It also causes the waves to jack up in size.

Vanuatu is the emerged part of an island arc, with a narrow rim delineated by a 2,000m (6000ft) isobath. Hence, when there is swell, it hits the coast with full strength. There are no lagoons or barrier reefs: there are only fringing reefs. This area is generally not more than 100m (300ft) wide and the reef is only a few metres thick. However, at some points, like Erakor Island on Efate, the fringing reef can be up to 2km (1.25mi) wide. Capital city Port-Vila sits on Efate, pretty much in the middle of the Vanuatu archipelago.

Being balanced between charter boats and surf camps, outboards in Fiji matter a lot. Departures times, rotation, schedules, carrying capacity, engine power, safety equipment, comfort factor and number of boats in operation are all important factors.

Considering these 15 islands sit in between world-class locations like Fiji, Tonga, Samoa and Tahiti, you would be forgiven for thinking that they must have awesome waves somewhere. The fact that they bear the name of the ultimate surf discoverer, James Cook, is not a guarantee of good surf and like Tubuai or Niue, the underwater topography doesn't  suit epic surf requirements. However, devoting a few weeks should ensure sampling some decent and definitely uncrowded high tide waves. The Cook Islands, spreading over a staggering 2.2 million km2 (1.4 million mi2) of ocean, consists of 2 groupings with 1500km (940mi) between the 2 most remote islands. The southern group includes nine volcanic islands, although some are virtually atolls : Aitutaki, Atiu, Mangaia, Manuae, Mauke, Mitiaro, Palmerston, Rarotonga and Takutea. The northern group comprises of six low coral atolls: Manihiki, Nassau, Tongareva (or Penrhyn), Pukapuka, Rakahanga and Suwarro.  The majority of the population lives in the southern group. The capital Rarotonga is volcanic with a rugged, eroded centre of peaks and ridges, surrounded by flat lowlands about 1 km wide. Since Rarotonga is the youngest island, it is physically unlike its other volcanic neighbours where erosion and periodic submersions have reduced mountains to gentle hills. Compared with other atolls, the lagoon surrounding Rarotonga is quite small, covering only 8km2 (5mi2) and is relatively shallow. The fringing reef defines the lagoon, which is broad and sandy to the south, and narrow and rocky on the north and east. Most of the reef passes are too narrow, preventing waves from wrapping properly, and explains why there is only a handful of surf spots in the Cook Islands. The waves break over shallow reef, so it's usually safest to surf at high tide and a decent-size swell will also help the waves to break in deeper water. All the reefbreaks are easily accessible by paddling out one of the passages or directly over the reef.

Best known are the Society Islands consisting of the Windward Group (Tahiti, Moorea, Tetiaroa) and the Leeward Group (Huahin\u00e8, Raiatea \/Tahaa, Maupiti and Bora Bora). Being only 200km (125mi) west of Tahiti, the Leeward Islands get pounded by the same swells; reef passes being the only surf spots. Most local wave-riders have escaped the Tahitian crowds to enjoy a privileged environment of idyllic tubular waves with a handful of close friends. Because these islands are so remote, with a long history of resistance against the official government, a strong feeling of ownership of the spots, namely localism, has developed. The Black Shorts on Huahine and Raiatea will only let outsiders surf with them once they have proved themselves to be their friends and loyal to the surf. This involves a long process of copious drinking at the local bars with them and much banter, handshaking, chest pounding and talking surf. Not everyone can do this so a cool attitude, a very low profile and a willingness to leave the surf if harassed are all essential ingredients.

The Tuamotu, which cover a territory as vast as western Europe 1800km (1125mi) long, 600km (375mi) wide, are undoubtedly the main group with 78 islands, 77 of them being atolls, the exception being Makatea, a raised coral island whose phosphate pits have been mined to exhaustion. This dusting of islands is also called The Labyrinth, or the Archipelago of the Rough Sea and has remained essentially uncharted due to the difficulty of navigating the local waters. The exotic appearance of these atolls are linked to the palm trees which have only been growing since 1860. Until then, the eroded peaks of the 2000-3000m (6100-9100ft) underwater mountains were merely flat barren patches of dead coral and white sands with no fresh water or soil to grow anything. In addition, the earlier natives, the Paumotus, were aggressive towards visitors, indulging in tribal wars and cannibalism until it was annexed to French Polynesia in 1880. In 1842, Darwin wrote that these atolls were the tops of old volcanoes and his theory was confirmed decades later. Mururoa and Fangataufa was the site for the now infamous nuclear testing program run by the French Government in the SE corner of the Tuamotu's. \n\n","coordinates":{"lat":-15.09,"lon":-147.72},"iso":"pf"},{"_id":175,"_obj":"SurfArea","_path":"SurfArea","url":"\/Rapa-Nui-Surfing\/175\/","name":"Rapa Nui","countryId":47,"timezone":"Pacific\/Easter","whenToGo":null,"pluses":["Year round swells","Powerful lava reefbreaks","Uncrowded south shore","Unreal history and location","Good weather clear water"],"minuses":["Big, wild waves","No quality beachbreaks","Sleepy Hanga Roa","Tricky exit\/entry points","Expensive and remote"],"monthInfo":[{"title":"Jan","rating":1,"wetsuit":8,"waterTemperature":"24","unit":"C"},{"title":"Feb","rating":1,"wetsuit":8,"waterTemperature":"24","unit":"C"},{"title":"Mar","rating":2,"wetsuit":8,"waterTemperature":"23","unit":"C"},{"title":"Apr","rating":2,"wetsuit":8,"waterTemperature":"23","unit":"C"},{"title":"May","rating":2,"wetsuit":null,"waterTemperature":"21","unit":"C"},{"title":"Jun","rating":2,"wetsuit":null,"waterTemperature":"21","unit":"C"},{"title":"Jul","rating":2,"wetsuit":null,"waterTemperature":"20","unit":"C"},{"title":"Aug","rating":2,"wetsuit":null,"waterTemperature":"20","unit":"C"},{"title":"Sep","rating":2,"wetsuit":null,"waterTemperature":"20","unit":"C"},{"title":"Oct","rating":1,"wetsuit":null,"waterTemperature":"20","unit":"C"},{"title":"Nov","rating":1,"wetsuit":null,"waterTemperature":"22","unit":"C"},{"title":"Dec","rating":1,"wetsuit":null,"waterTemperature":"22","unit":"C"}],"description":"Known as Rapa Nui by its inhabitants, Easter Island is the most remote, inhabited place on earth.

Te-Pito-O-Te-Henua (the navel of the world) is one large open-air museum; a UN designated archaeological site of 'humankind treasure'. Its world-famous statues, the Moais, are 10-63ft (3-21m) tall, made of volcanic basaltic rock, weigh between 20-300tonnes and are thought to represent the faces of the royalty who ruled each of the 33 original tribes that lived on the island until the 16th century. These Moais are the largest monolithic expression in the entire Polynesian culture and amazingly, were moved as much as 18km (11mi) without mechanical help - legend has it they were moved by Mana, spiritual power. The island was formed by an eruption 3 million years ago from a single volcano in the bottom of the ocean. Geologically, the coastline is too young to have developed proper sandy beaches and consists of rugged lava cliffs, with heights between 6-23ft(2-7m) making entry\/exit points scarce. Most spots are along the west and south coasts, plus two average quality beachbreaks with remarkable scenery on the north coast. There are no protected bays or points, but south coast exploration will reveal a safe bend or natural pool on the coastline to get in and out. Local surfers are friendly and open, showing typical Polynesian pride in their island and culture that demands respect.

Its undisputed attractions challenge every surfer on the planet to find out if they have got what it takes. Conquering the fear of dropping into a bomb at Pipe, or paddling over the edge of a Waimea cliff represent the zenith of the surfing experience. Thousands make the pilgrimage every year to the Hawaiian Islands, which are tips of volcanic mountains, that rise precipitously from the ocean floor. There's no continental shelf or barrier reef to dampen the force of the powerful swells that come thundering out of the North Pacific and slam into the world's most famous surf zone on Oahu's beautiful North Shore. Reverentially dubbed 'The Seven Mile Miracle'  this short, savage coastline between Haleiwa and Velzyland has it all from kiddies reforms to tow-in monsters of the deep, often displayed tantalisingly close to shore. The North Shore coast faces due northwest, and early season W swells tend to break cleaner at many spots than N or NE swells, plus they also do a good job of scouring away the summer sand build-up so the reefs are exposed and the beach angle backwash is reduced. Whatever the swell direction, the surf here can jump from 2ft to 15ft (0.6-5m) within a few hours and sneaker sets are common. On smaller swells, most spots break on lava reef close to golden sand beaches with deep channels, which make paddling out easier but also create some strong rips in larger surf. From mid Nov-Jan, all the professional surfers in the world flock to Hawaii, and it becomes a major achievement to snag a wave off the hungry pack. The town of Haleiwa, with a variety of facilities and amenities, is the commercial centre of the North Shore.","coordinates":{"lat":21.6682,"lon":-158.051},"iso":"us"},{"_id":177,"_obj":"SurfArea","_path":"SurfArea","url":"\/Kauai-Surfing\/177\/","name":"Kauai","countryId":172,"timezone":"Pacific\/Honolulu","whenToGo":null,"pluses":["Year round swells","Hawaiian power and culture","Super scenic island","Variety of coastline","Hawaiian surf culture"],"minuses":["Mostly experts only surf","Protective locals","High local prices","Rainy and windy","Sharks"],"monthInfo":[{"title":"Jan","rating":2,"wetsuit":8,"waterTemperature":"24","unit":"C"},{"title":"Feb","rating":2,"wetsuit":8,"waterTemperature":"24","unit":"C"},{"title":"Mar","rating":2,"wetsuit":8,"waterTemperature":"24","unit":"C"},{"title":"Apr","rating":1,"wetsuit":8,"waterTemperature":"24","unit":"C"},{"title":"May","rating":1,"wetsuit":8,"waterTemperature":"25","unit":"C"},{"title":"Jun","rating":1,"wetsuit":8,"waterTemperature":"25","unit":"C"},{"title":"Jul","rating":1,"wetsuit":8,"waterTemperature":"26","unit":"C"},{"title":"Aug","rating":1,"wetsuit":8,"waterTemperature":"26","unit":"C"},{"title":"Sep","rating":1,"wetsuit":8,"waterTemperature":"27","unit":"C"},{"title":"Oct","rating":2,"wetsuit":8,"waterTemperature":"27","unit":"C"},{"title":"Nov","rating":2,"wetsuit":8,"waterTemperature":"25","unit":"C"},{"title":"Dec","rating":2,"wetsuit":8,"waterTemperature":"25","unit":"C"}],"description":"Known as the 'The Garden Island', Kauai is an ancient and deeply eroded extinct volcano, rising 5000m (15,250ft) above the sea floor.

There are more sandy beaches than many other islands and nearly 45% of its coastline is virtually deserted.

Unlike Sumatra, isolation and tricky access aren't  to blame here, since Java's 110 million inhabitants often utilize the island's many coastal resorts. Fortunately, the laidback atmosphere and beautiful scenery make up for the lack of epic waves and surfers consider Pangandaran as the place to be. Located on an isthmus of a teardrop-shaped peninsula near the west Java\/central Java border, Pangandaran is a popular beach resort for both domestic tourists from the city of Bandung and backpackers looking to add a few beach days to their cultural tour of the island. The traditional fishing village has long understood the profit it could gain from its long black-sand beach lined with coconut palms and is slowly turning into one of the largest Javanese beach resorts. \n\n","coordinates":{"lat":-7.6911,"lon":108.636},"iso":"id"},{"_id":186,"_obj":"SurfArea","_path":"SurfArea","url":"\/East-Bali-Surfing\/186\/","name":"East Bali","countryId":78,"timezone":"Asia\/Makassar","whenToGo":null,"pluses":["Many world class spots","Perfect left set-ups","Interesting culture","Tourist heaven","Cheap"],"minuses":["Crowded waves","Busy and noisy streets","Touts and hustlers"],"description":"Bali is 'The island of 1000 temples' which the locals believe is blessed by the gods.

It was this that caused the first Philippino surf explorers to rush here in the mid '80s. In 1988 Surfer magazine published the story of a trip to this Island showing pictures of a palm fringed, white sand beach with a barrelling righthander just offshore. This was Majestics, and it put the Philippines under the surf world's spotlight. However the pictures were deceiving, not showing how quickly the wave breaks or how Inconsistent it is. Many surfers have been drawn here by the pictures and ended up spending weeks waiting around for Majestics to do its thing. This Inconsistency has led surfers to explore other areas, most notably Samar, Camarines, Siargao and the main Island of Luzon, which has the highest number of known surf spots. On Luzon, Charlie's point In Aurora province is the most well known wave, having been made famous through the film Apocalypse Now. Potentially the best Luzon spots are found on the W coast around La Union close to San Fernando, this is the South China Sea, and it produces reliable wind swells during the NE monsoon from Nov to April.

Withdrawn and insular for decades, the events of September 11th 2001, placed the country firmly in the international spotlight, due to its location as Afghanistan's neighbour. Earlier that year, a crew of 12 people including four surfers explored the Makran Desert's coast looking for rideable surfspots in the Baluchistan province. In 325BC, Alexander the Great and his army marched through its harsh desert wastes and suffered heavy loss of life from shortages of food and water. Until 1809, no other Europeans visited the Makran. In terms of physical geography, Baluchistan has more in common with Western Asia than with the Sub-Continent. Its wild and mysterious desert vistas contain formidable mountain ranges of amazing rock formations, dramatically contoured and twisted by the Earth's violent geological movements. The Makran Coast's deserted sandy beaches stretch 700km (438mi) along the Arabian Sea. Around Karachi there are several spots surfed by expats and travellers fresh off the plane, like the Paradise Cove beachbreak and the best pointbreak, Goth Munjar on the Hub rivermouth. The main problem with the Makran Coast is simple: it's too shallow! Most of the white-clay cliffs erode into the sea, building huge, shallow banks, especially around reefs and capes, dissipating rather than focusing the swell power. The best coastal feature for finding surf is on the hammer-shaped headlands that once were islands but became joined to the mainland by a thin sand or shingle bar (tombolos), such as Ormara and Gwadar. This region is located on very active tectonic plates, which constantly shake up to 3 on the Richter Scale.","coordinates":{"lat":21.8266,"lon":59.5619},"iso":"om"},{"_id":209,"_obj":"SurfArea","_path":"SurfArea","url":"\/Huvadhoo-Atoll-Surfing\/209\/","name":"Huvadhoo Atoll","countryId":81,"timezone":"Indian\/Maldives","whenToGo":null,"pluses":["Atoll pass perfection","Only a few charter boats","Calm water cruising","Awesome fishing and scenery"],"minuses":["Stormy winter seas","No land camp option","Long transfers","Expensive charters"],"monthInfo":[{"title":"Jan","rating":0,"wetsuit":8,"waterTemperature":"28","unit":"C"},{"title":"Feb","rating":1,"wetsuit":8,"waterTemperature":"28","unit":"C"},{"title":"Mar","rating":2,"wetsuit":8,"waterTemperature":"29","unit":"C"},{"title":"Apr","rating":2,"wetsuit":8,"waterTemperature":"29","unit":"C"},{"title":"May","rating":1,"wetsuit":8,"waterTemperature":"29","unit":"C"},{"title":"Jun","rating":0,"wetsuit":8,"waterTemperature":"29","unit":"C"},{"title":"Jul","rating":0,"wetsuit":8,"waterTemperature":"28","unit":"C"},{"title":"Aug","rating":1,"wetsuit":8,"waterTemperature":"28","unit":"C"},{"title":"Sep","rating":2,"wetsuit":8,"waterTemperature":"28","unit":"C"},{"title":"Oct","rating":2,"wetsuit":8,"waterTemperature":"28","unit":"C"},{"title":"Nov","rating":1,"wetsuit":8,"waterTemperature":"28","unit":"C"},{"title":"Dec","rating":0,"wetsuit":8,"waterTemperature":"28","unit":"C"}],"description":"26 pancake-flat atolls of the Maldives are coralline formations that formed around the edges of volcanic peaks, thrusting up from diverging plates in the Earth's crust.

The bulk of the 239 Andaman Islands are known as the North, Middle, and South Andaman, which along with Baratang and Rut-Land forms one land mass known as the Great Andaman's. With only 36 inhabited islands, this region is a mass of dense forests with endless varieties of exotic flowers and birds. Thick, tropical forests cloak the hilly terrain and the meandering, sandy beaches are fringed with coconut palms, swaying to the rhythm of the monsoon. South Andaman is by far the most densely populated island, especially around its capital city, Port Blair (80,000). The islands have a fragile ecosystem and in order to preserve the tranquillity and protect the diverse and unique array of flora and fauna, there are 96 sanctuaries and 9 national parks.","iso":"in"},{"_id":212,"_obj":"SurfArea","_path":"SurfArea","url":"\/South-West-Sri-Lanka-Surfing\/212\/","name":"South West Sri Lanka","countryId":77,"timezone":"Asia\/Colombo","whenToGo":null,"pluses":["Quality mellow waves","Offshore NE monsoon","Buddhist mecca","Cheap"],"minuses":["Conflicting wind and swell patterns","Small waves","No world class spots","Sewage and localism","Civil unrest"],"monthInfo":[{"title":"Jan","rating":1,"wetsuit":8,"waterTemperature":"27","unit":"C"},{"title":"Feb","rating":2,"wetsuit":8,"waterTemperature":"27","unit":"C"},{"title":"Mar","rating":1,"wetsuit":8,"waterTemperature":"28","unit":"C"},{"title":"Apr","rating":0,"wetsuit":8,"waterTemperature":"28","unit":"C"},{"title":"May","rating":0,"wetsuit":8,"waterTemperature":"28","unit":"C"},{"title":"Jun","rating":0,"wetsuit":8,"waterTemperature":"28","unit":"C"},{"title":"Jul","rating":0,"wetsuit":8,"waterTemperature":"28","unit":"C"},{"title":"Aug","rating":0,"wetsuit":8,"waterTemperature":"28","unit":"C"},{"title":"Sep","rating":0,"wetsuit":8,"waterTemperature":"27","unit":"C"},{"title":"Oct","rating":0,"wetsuit":8,"waterTemperature":"27","unit":"C"},{"title":"Nov","rating":1,"wetsuit":8,"waterTemperature":"27","unit":"C"},{"title":"Dec","rating":1,"wetsuit":8,"waterTemperature":"27","unit":"C"}],"description":"Sri Lanka, a teardrop shaped island below India, is the highest latitude, reliable surf destination in the Indian Ocean.

Nestled below the 'Armpit of Africa', few foreigners make the journey, while the sparse local surfing population rarely travel beyond France. Most of the known spots are located close to Port-Gentil and the capital, Libreville, where expatriates provide the greatest number of potential surfers among the city's 300,000 population. West Africans have long harboured a distinct fear and mistrust of the ocean, leaving the bulk of the population firmly on dry land with limited swimming skills. \nTo escape the virtually waveless estuary of Libreville, drive north on one of the few paved roads to Cape Esterias, or get a boat to Ekwata. Ferme aux Crocos (Crocodile Farm) is a private beach resort reached by 4x4 with a wide beach and sloppy shorebreak waves. There is a rideable wave in Libreville at Gueque but it is very poor quality. On the west side of the Gabon Estuary are the ten neat beach bungalows, which make up Ekwata village. From here, it is a 15 minute walk up to Ngomb\u00e8 lighthouse where an occasional long wrapping left breaks over the shiny black stones that line the coast. When it is on, it's a very long wave, so head for the beach and walk back to the peak under the shade of the trees. The main problem with this estuarine area is that even at a full 20km  (12mi) out to sea, the water depth remains a mere 40m (130ft) deep, draining the power from the swell. The beach skirts a swampy savannah full of birds, monkeys and elephants, while to the south surfing opportunities diminish in the shadow of Port Gentil and heavy silting in the Baie de Nazare. \n","iso":"ga"},{"_id":221,"_obj":"SurfArea","_path":"SurfArea","url":"\/Luanda-and-Bengo-Surfing\/221\/","name":"Luanda and Bengo","countryId":162,"timezone":"Africa\/Luanda","whenToGo":null,"pluses":["Easy, long left pointbreaks","Consistent swells","Warmish water","Undiscovered"],"minuses":["Windy, exposed spots","Costly flights and visas","No tourism infrastructure","Warm zone, land mines","Sharks and crocs"],"monthInfo":[{"title":"Jan","rating":0,"wetsuit":8,"waterTemperature":"26","unit":"C"},{"title":"Feb","rating":0,"wetsuit":8,"waterTemperature":"26","unit":"C"},{"title":"Mar","rating":1,"wetsuit":8,"waterTemperature":"26","unit":"C"},{"title":"Apr","rating":1,"wetsuit":8,"waterTemperature":"26","unit":"C"},{"title":"May","rating":2,"wetsuit":8,"waterTemperature":"24","unit":"C"},{"title":"Jun","rating":2,"wetsuit":8,"waterTemperature":"24","unit":"C"},{"title":"Jul","rating":2,"wetsuit":null,"waterTemperature":"21","unit":"C"},{"title":"Aug","rating":2,"wetsuit":null,"waterTemperature":"21","unit":"C"},{"title":"Sep","rating":2,"wetsuit":null,"waterTemperature":"23","unit":"C"},{"title":"Oct","rating":1,"wetsuit":null,"waterTemperature":"23","unit":"C"},{"title":"Nov","rating":0,"wetsuit":8,"waterTemperature":"25","unit":"C"},{"title":"Dec","rating":0,"wetsuit":8,"waterTemperature":"25","unit":"C"}],"description":"It's impossible to talk about Angola without looking at the dismal political situation.

However, this means Perth is an ideal place to learn, plus there is the added bonus of Rottnest Island, where some serious waves can be had, a short ferry ride from the city. Prior to two significant changes in sea level over 7,000 years ago, Rottnest was initially attached to the mainland. Local Aboriginal people knew the Island as 'Wadjemup', which has been suggested to have the meaning land across the water. The island was named in 1696 by the Dutch explorer Willem de Vlamingh, who called it 'Rottnest' (meaning 'rats nest'), mistaking the marsupial quokkas for huge rats.","coordinates":{"lat":-32.0191,"lon":115.486},"iso":"au"},{"_id":232,"_obj":"SurfArea","_path":"SurfArea","url":"\/South-West-Australia-Surfing\/232\/","name":"South-West Australia","countryId":67,"timezone":"Australia\/Perth","whenToGo":null,"pluses":["Massive swell exposure","World class reefs","Lots of power","Dramatic coastline"],"minuses":["Cold and wet winters","Isolated, dangerous reefs","Windy","4WD access"],"monthInfo":[{"title":"Jan","rating":1,"wetsuit":5,"waterTemperature":"19","unit":"C"},{"title":"Feb","rating":1,"wetsuit":5,"waterTemperature":"19","unit":"C"},{"title":"Mar","rating":2,"wetsuit":null,"waterTemperature":"21","unit":"C"},{"title":"Apr","rating":1,"wetsuit":null,"waterTemperature":"21","unit":"C"},{"title":"May","rating":1,"wetsuit":5,"waterTemperature":"19","unit":"C"},{"title":"Jun","rating":0,"wetsuit":5,"waterTemperature":"19","unit":"C"},{"title":"Jul","rating":0,"wetsuit":5,"waterTemperature":"17","unit":"C"},{"title":"Aug","rating":1,"wetsuit":5,"waterTemperature":"17","unit":"C"},{"title":"Sep","rating":2,"wetsuit":5,"waterTemperature":"16","unit":"C"},{"title":"Oct","rating":2,"wetsuit":5,"waterTemperature":"16","unit":"C"},{"title":"Nov","rating":1,"wetsuit":5,"waterTemperature":"18","unit":"C"},{"title":"Dec","rating":1,"wetsuit":5,"waterTemperature":"18","unit":"C"}],"description":"Surfing has become synonymous with Australia, especially on the East Coast where the large surfing population are exposed to numerous contests held in generally small surf and constantly canvassed by the industry and mainstream media.

Dolphins and sharks frequent the veritable array of long golden beaches and rocky headlands that have attracted surfers for almost half a century. From a sleepy coastal hippy town that encompassed the N.S.W North Coast vibe, Byron has mutated into a virtual city, attracting movie stars, property developers and hordes of backpackers. While there are some epic set-ups, a lack of decent size swell dictates conditions are fairly inconsistent, relying on summer cyclone swells or big winter south's to create waves worth remembering. Typically, shoulder high waves snap across the sandbanks in clean, small size swells, while bigger days see short, steep close-outs relying primarily on wind and tide to give rideable waves at the main beaches. It's these bigger days that get the handful of pointbreaks to rumble into life when locals descend from miles around. Byron Bay gained its popularity in the '60s as a stop on the ultimate road trip from Sydney to Noosa, at a time when 10ft mals would ideally fit the ruler-edged, leisurely right points that dot the coast.

From big-wave bays to the most gutless longboard reefs, LA has all the bases covered. The span from Point Mugu to Santa Monica faces almost due S, and its beaches want solid S and W swells to transform them into surf spots (although WNWs do wrap in to some nooks and crannies). W swells generally have no problem in producing quality surf along this stretch of coast. To the south, from Santa Monica to Rancho Palos Verdes, the coast bends into a WSW-facing direction, thus picking up loads more swell than anywhere else in the county. Winter swells are funneled directly into the Palos Verdes Peninsula, thanks to a deep-water submarine canyon, thus the large seasonal reef surf here. The Long Beach area is basically shielded from all swells by the Peninsula and the gargantuan breakwall.\nIn the years before the breakwall was constructed, Long Beach was a great place to be a surfer. As a whole, Los Angeles County is as consistent as Ventura and picks up a tad more swell than San Diego and Orange counties, especially in the South Bay and around the Palos Verdes Peninsula. However, with the exception of the Peninsula and the area north of Santa Monica, most of LA is beachbreak; you can cruise for hours looking for a wave that holds up longer than five seconds. But, summer or winter, you can almost always find a decent wave around the Palos Verdes Peninsula, which is essentially the crown jewel of LA surfing, apart from Malibu. Onshore wind is a problem on more-westerly-facing beaches, as it usually begins like clockwork at about 11a.m. unless there's a storm.\n","coordinates":{"lat":33.7714,"lon":-118.427},"iso":"us"},{"_id":243,"_obj":"SurfArea","_path":"SurfArea","url":"\/Orange-County-North-Surfing\/243\/","name":"Orange County - North","countryId":145,"timezone":"America\/Los_Angeles","whenToGo":null,"pluses":["Variety of spots","Lots of clean waves","Great weather","Entertaining area"],"minuses":["Constant, competitive crowd","Relatively cool water","Pollution","Urban atmosphere"],"monthInfo":[{"title":"Jan","rating":1,"wetsuit":4,"waterTemperature":"14","unit":"C"},{"title":"Feb","rating":1,"wetsuit":4,"waterTemperature":"14","unit":"C"},{"title":"Mar","rating":1,"wetsuit":4,"waterTemperature":"14","unit":"C"},{"title":"Apr","rating":0,"wetsuit":4,"waterTemperature":"14","unit":"C"},{"title":"May","rating":0,"wetsuit":5,"waterTemperature":"16","unit":"C"},{"title":"Jun","rating":1,"wetsuit":5,"waterTemperature":"16","unit":"C"},{"title":"Jul","rating":1,"wetsuit":5,"waterTemperature":"17","unit":"C"},{"title":"Aug","rating":1,"wetsuit":5,"waterTemperature":"17","unit":"C"},{"title":"Sep","rating":2,"wetsuit":5,"waterTemperature":"16","unit":"C"},{"title":"Oct","rating":2,"wetsuit":5,"waterTemperature":"16","unit":"C"},{"title":"Nov","rating":2,"wetsuit":5,"waterTemperature":"15","unit":"C"},{"title":"Dec","rating":1,"wetsuit":5,"waterTemperature":"15","unit":"C"}],"description":"Southern Californian surfing started in 1907 when Hawai'ian George Freeth performed for a huge crowd at Redondo Beach.

Semi-tropical, year round climate and a culture dedicated to leisure doesn't  offset the generally poor sandbanks and mushy conditions that occur most of the time. Hurricanes are the exception to the rule when powerful lines of swell will turn on classic waves at a few spots, but the wait can be misery. Florida's long Atlantic coastline consists of barrier islands, separated from the mainland by the Intracoastal Waterway. To the west, there's the equally long Gulf Coast, which has erratic surf at best. The beaches near Miami suffer from the swell blocking shadow of the Bahamas but Palm Beach County has the best aspect for NE swells and has a few breaks that handle the biggest swells. The North Coast from Jacksonville to New Smyrna Beach features a long stretch of flat beaches which you can drive along to choose one of the endless peaks between the occasional jetties and inlets. However, it is the centrally located 'Space Coast' that is the surf industry cradle and home to such famous locations as Cocoa Beach and Sebastian Inlet. \n\n","coordinates":{"lat":28.1728,"lon":-80.5878},"iso":"us"},{"_id":253,"_obj":"SurfArea","_path":"SurfArea","url":"\/Indian-River-St-Lucie-and-Martin-Counties-Surfing\/253\/","name":"Indian River, St Lucie and Martin Counties","countryId":42,"timezone":"America\/New_York","whenToGo":null,"pluses":[],"minuses":[],"monthInfo":[{"title":"Jan","rating":1,"wetsuit":5,"waterTemperature":"16","unit":"C"},{"title":"Feb","rating":1,"wetsuit":5,"waterTemperature":"16","unit":"C"},{"title":"Mar","rating":1,"wetsuit":null,"waterTemperature":"20","unit":"C"},{"title":"Apr","rating":0,"wetsuit":null,"waterTemperature":"20","unit":"C"},{"title":"May","rating":0,"wetsuit":8,"waterTemperature":"24","unit":"C"},{"title":"Jun","rating":0,"wetsuit":8,"waterTemperature":"24","unit":"C"},{"title":"Jul","rating":1,"wetsuit":8,"waterTemperature":"26","unit":"C"},{"title":"Aug","rating":1,"wetsuit":8,"waterTemperature":"26","unit":"C"},{"title":"Sep","rating":2,"wetsuit":8,"waterTemperature":"24","unit":"C"},{"title":"Oct","rating":2,"wetsuit":8,"waterTemperature":"24","unit":"C"},{"title":"Nov","rating":2,"wetsuit":null,"waterTemperature":"21","unit":"C"},{"title":"Dec","rating":1,"wetsuit":null,"waterTemperature":"21","unit":"C"}],"description":"Exactly where Central Florida begins and ends is a matter of conjecture, but we have set our boundaries as Cape Canaveral in Brevard County in the north down to St Lucie County. Anywhere south of Jupiter Island in Martin County, the shadow of the Bahamas prevents east or southeast groundswells from arriving at the South Florida beaches. It might be argued that Fort Pierce is the cut-off point, but its mid-county position and water temps (it can be radically colder than 40 miles to the south) point towards Hobe Sound and the St Lucie Inlet as being the more user-friendly line of demarcation.\nBrevard County epitomizes the Florida surf scene in three of its most important beaches. Cocoa Beach has a reputation for small waves, the biggest surf shops, and being home to the consummate surfing professional, Kelly Slater. Indialantic\/Melbourne Beach has become a surf industry hotspot, lorded over by Eastern Surf Magazine, the voice of the right coast surfer. At the southern boundary of Brevard Co. is a beach that has built its reputation on quality waves, small or large, and is the proving ground for all Florida surfers. Sebastian Inlet is the most revered East Coast surf spot thanks to the wedging rights that peak and peel off the long north jetty\nBetween Cocoa and Sebastian, there are a few more quality waves, some of which break on coquina reefs, a commonplace geological phenomenon in central and southern Florida. These formations (soft limestone sandwiches of shells and dead coral) create stable launching pads that trip larger swells, transforming small, mellow beachbreak waves into large, fast, challenging screamers that peel like freight trains along the shelf. RC's is the most notable of these reef breaks in Brevard County, but it requires some N in the swell, so hurricane swells are not always the best, as a more E swell direction causes many of the breaks to close out.\nIndian River County and St Lucie County are flanked by more illustrious surf zones that remain under the radar of media attention, which is just fine for the local crews. Coquina reefs provide some stability and reliability to the surf at places like Stuart Rocks, while the inlet breakwater at Fort Pierce is a real swell magnet. Access in this area is far better than in the exclusive and exclusionary world of the gated beachfront communities and condos that dominate the coast in South Florida, and there are plenty of beachbreaks to escape the concentrations of able surfers at the main spots.\nHurricanes are seasonal depressions that only form in sub-tropical latitudes (10\u00b0-30\u00b0) when the contrasts between sea and air temperatures are at their greatest. East Coast surfers become amateur meteorologists when it comes to tracking these counter-clockwise spinning storms, but even the professionals on the Weather Channel find it difficult to predict their erratic paths\nCentral Florida has excellent exposure to these storms that spin through the hurricane alley from the West Africa coast to the Caribbean, where they will either cross into the Gulf or swing N and head up the East Coast of the continent. Surfers must temper their prayers for these swell producers against the possible havoc they can wreak if they make landfall. Provider and destroyer in one package, hurricanes are a two-edged sword responsible for accelerating erosion, damaging hard structures (mainly piers), causing massive stormwater problems, overloading outfall systems, sewage, and agricultural holding tanks, plus generally filling the line-up with debris.\n","coordinates":{"lat":27.4327,"lon":-80.2785},"iso":"us"},{"_id":254,"_obj":"SurfArea","_path":"SurfArea","url":"\/Martin-Co-South-Palm-Beach-Co-North-Surfing\/254\/","name":"Martin Co. - South\/Palm Beach Co.

Perhaps word will get around among these predators that foam and fiberglass make a nasty nibble.\n","coordinates":{"lat":42.4166,"lon":-124.432},"iso":"us"},{"_id":259,"_obj":"SurfArea","_path":"SurfArea","url":"\/Del-Norte-County-Surfing\/259\/","name":"Del Norte County","countryId":22,"timezone":"America\/Los_Angeles","whenToGo":null,"pluses":[],"minuses":[],"monthInfo":[{"title":"Jan","rating":1,"wetsuit":2,"waterTemperature":"10","unit":"C"},{"title":"Feb","rating":1,"wetsuit":2,"waterTemperature":"10","unit":"C"},{"title":"Mar","rating":0,"wetsuit":2,"waterTemperature":"11","unit":"C"},{"title":"Apr","rating":0,"wetsuit":2,"waterTemperature":"11","unit":"C"},{"title":"May","rating":0,"wetsuit":4,"waterTemperature":"12","unit":"C"},{"title":"Jun","rating":1,"wetsuit":4,"waterTemperature":"12","unit":"C"},{"title":"Jul","rating":1,"wetsuit":4,"waterTemperature":"14","unit":"C"},{"title":"Aug","rating":1,"wetsuit":4,"waterTemperature":"14","unit":"C"},{"title":"Sep","rating":2,"wetsuit":4,"waterTemperature":"13","unit":"C"},{"title":"Oct","rating":2,"wetsuit":4,"waterTemperature":"13","unit":"C"},{"title":"Nov","rating":2,"wetsuit":2,"waterTemperature":"11","unit":"C"},{"title":"Dec","rating":1,"wetsuit":2,"waterTemperature":"11","unit":"C"}],"description":"With the exception of Wilson Creek, none of the Del Norte (the 'e' in Norte is silent) coast is really accessible until you hit Crescent City, but there are some fine vistas from Highway 101 along the way. Wide open to wind and swell, miles of moody dune-backed beachbreak can be accessed through the towns of Fort Dick and Smith River. The hub of the county's surfing, however, is Crescent City, a true south-facing 'crescent.' As a result, South Beach is always a lot smaller and cleaner than surrounding spots, making it rather popular, especially during the persistent N winds of spring. Del Norte takes all swells, although S and SW are quite rare. Similar to Oregon, Del Norte is never flat, but the issue of access and actual number of legitimate surf spots is a tough one, not to mention frequently unfavorable winds and an often depressing, gray climate. Most of the swell comes from the NW, and since storms are relatively close offshore, conditions are frequently junky with swells accompanied with strong winds. Most of Del Norte's surf is beachbreak.","coordinates":{"lat":41.7432,"lon":-124.176},"iso":"us"},{"_id":260,"_obj":"SurfArea","_path":"SurfArea","url":"\/Humboldt-County-North-Surfing\/260\/","name":"Humboldt County - North","countryId":22,"timezone":"America\/Los_Angeles","whenToGo":null,"pluses":["Big, consistent swells\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","Uncrowded Californian surf","Offshore winds during storms","Beautiful scenery","Huge redwood trees"],"minuses":["Onshore winds and fog\r\n\r\n\r\n","Swells often too gnarly","Harsh climate\r\n","Cold Water","Great white sharks"],"monthInfo":[{"title":"Jan","rating":1,"wetsuit":2,"waterTemperature":"9","unit":"C"},{"title":"Feb","rating":1,"wetsuit":2,"waterTemperature":"9","unit":"C"},{"title":"Mar","rating":2,"wetsuit":2,"waterTemperature":"10","unit":"C"},{"title":"Apr","rating":2,"wetsuit":2,"waterTemperature":"10","unit":"C"},{"title":"May","rating":1,"wetsuit":2,"waterTemperature":"10","unit":"C"},{"title":"Jun","rating":1,"wetsuit":2,"waterTemperature":"10","unit":"C"},{"title":"Jul","rating":1,"wetsuit":2,"waterTemperature":"9","unit":"C"},{"title":"Aug","rating":1,"wetsuit":2,"waterTemperature":"9","unit":"C"},{"title":"Sep","rating":2,"wetsuit":2,"waterTemperature":"10","unit":"C"},{"title":"Oct","rating":2,"wetsuit":2,"waterTemperature":"10","unit":"C"},{"title":"Nov","rating":2,"wetsuit":2,"waterTemperature":"10","unit":"C"},{"title":"Dec","rating":1,"wetsuit":2,"waterTemperature":"10","unit":"C"}],"description":"Almost everything is big in Humboldt County, especially the waves.

Much of this stretch of coast is either inaccessible or unrideable, so don't  get your hopes set on finding a coldwater paradise. From Westport all the way south to Gualala, there are no world-class pointbreaks, reefs, or beachbreaks, but the spots Mendocino does have can get quite good on rare occasions, generally during autumn or on the smaller days of winter. Most popular North Mendocino spots are Virgin Creek and Chadbourne Gulch, and although there's a lot of coast beyond those spots, for some reason surfers seem to flock together. North of Westport, the coast intensifies and morphs into the Lost Coast, a harshly forbidding stretch of cliff and rock remaining inaccessible and unridden.\nWide open to swell and wind from all directions, this rugged coastline can play with a surfer's degree of optimism, no matter what season it is. Prevailing swells come out of the NW and are often lumpy due to the proximity of the generating storms. The prevailing winds are also from the NW, so the surf is often blown-out. As with the rest of Northern California, Mendocino gets very windy. South swells generally go unridden except in the Point Arena vicinity, and W swells have basically the same effect on the coastline as NWs do \u2013 without high-quality bottom contours, much swell is wasted, and the beachbreaks can't  handle size. Large stretches of the Mendocino coast are unfortunately publicly inaccessible, but it doesn't  really matter since the private stuff hides no gems. Sheer cliffs and insanely rocky beaches are the norm in South Mendocino.\nMendocino County is a very fickle wave ground, but the surf is seldom flat, so there's almost always somewhere rideable, even during the smallest of summer swells. Much of winter is unsurfable, while spring can feature howling onshore winds for weeks on end. Summer is often junky and foggy; autumn is the best bet for favorable conditions. Don't  come to Mendocino expecting good waves, and you won't  be disappointed. Still, you might get lucky.\n","coordinates":{"lat":39.4635,"lon":-123.81},"iso":"us"},{"_id":263,"_obj":"SurfArea","_path":"SurfArea","url":"\/Marin-County-Surfing\/263\/","name":"Marin County","countryId":22,"timezone":"America\/Los_Angeles","whenToGo":null,"pluses":[],"minuses":[],"monthInfo":[{"title":"Jan","rating":1,"wetsuit":4,"waterTemperature":"12","unit":"C"},{"title":"Feb","rating":1,"wetsuit":4,"waterTemperature":"12","unit":"C"},{"title":"Mar","rating":2,"wetsuit":4,"waterTemperature":"13","unit":"C"},{"title":"Apr","rating":1,"wetsuit":4,"waterTemperature":"13","unit":"C"},{"title":"May","rating":1,"wetsuit":4,"waterTemperature":"13","unit":"C"},{"title":"Jun","rating":0,"wetsuit":4,"waterTemperature":"13","unit":"C"},{"title":"Jul","rating":0,"wetsuit":4,"waterTemperature":"14","unit":"C"},{"title":"Aug","rating":0,"wetsuit":4,"waterTemperature":"14","unit":"C"},{"title":"Sep","rating":1,"wetsuit":4,"waterTemperature":"14","unit":"C"},{"title":"Oct","rating":2,"wetsuit":4,"waterTemperature":"14","unit":"C"},{"title":"Nov","rating":2,"wetsuit":4,"waterTemperature":"13","unit":"C"},{"title":"Dec","rating":1,"wetsuit":4,"waterTemperature":"13","unit":"C"}],"description":"Marin is the smallest of the NorCal counties, and it's not exactly known for its surf. It is all beachbreak with rare exceptions. This is also one of the sharkiest places on Earth (it's the northern boundary of the so-called 'Red Triangle'), so Marin is hardly worth visiting if you're  not feeling lucky. Most of the county's shoreline is within the immense Point Reyes National Seashore, a wonderland of tangled woods, serene estuaries, grassy knolls, and windblown (and wind-sheltered) beachbreak. But, if not for the surf, check this place out just for its unspoiled vastness.\nWhen the rest of the Marin coast is flat, there will be some kind of surf at Point Reyes Beach (north side), albeit often junky. It's a good option during the summer if the winds are calm. The place sticks so far out into the sea, it's susceptible to all kinds of weird currents and wind fronts coming from the open ocean. The waves do get good in Marin, albeit seldom, and since distances are far between surf spots, you'll  surely encounter some sluggish tourist traffic, especially on weekends. Bolinas is a hot area, as is Stinson Beach. North, at the mouth of shark-infested Tomales Bay, Dillon Beach sees a fair number of surfers on any given day, but Bolinas and Cronkhite Beach are by far the most crowded (Cronkhite is most easily accessible from the San Francisco Bay Area). Check out other beaches along the Golden Gate National Recreation Area and Marin Headland for other good spots that come and go as conditions vary.\nPoint Reyes blocks winter NW swells from making it into Bolinas Bay, but a W will get in nicely \u2013 a good place during bouts of huge winter swell and NNW winds, which blow offshore at the south-facing beaches. Bolinas Bay does pull in S swells, although they are rare and when they do arrive, the place is packed with surfers. The south side of Point Reyes is also exposed to S swells, which take the prevailing summer NW winds right in the face. Of course, S winds spell disaster at these spots.\n","coordinates":{"lat":37.8308,"lon":-122.539},"iso":"us"},{"_id":264,"_obj":"SurfArea","_path":"SurfArea","url":"\/Maine-North-Surfing\/264\/","name":"Maine - North","countryId":28,"timezone":"America\/New_York","whenToGo":null,"pluses":[],"minuses":[],"monthInfo":[{"title":"Jan","rating":1,"wetsuit":1,"waterTemperature":"1","unit":"C"},{"title":"Feb","rating":0,"wetsuit":1,"waterTemperature":"1","unit":"C"},{"title":"Mar","rating":0,"wetsuit":1,"waterTemperature":"4\/39","unit":"C"},{"title":"Apr","rating":0,"wetsuit":1,"waterTemperature":"4\/39","unit":"C"},{"title":"May","rating":0,"wetsuit":4,"waterTemperature":"11","unit":"C"},{"title":"Jun","rating":0,"wetsuit":4,"waterTemperature":"11","unit":"C"},{"title":"Jul","rating":1,"wetsuit":5,"waterTemperature":"16","unit":"C"},{"title":"Aug","rating":2,"wetsuit":5,"waterTemperature":"16","unit":"C"},{"title":"Sep","rating":2,"wetsuit":4,"waterTemperature":"12","unit":"C"},{"title":"Oct","rating":2,"wetsuit":4,"waterTemperature":"12","unit":"C"},{"title":"Nov","rating":2,"wetsuit":1,"waterTemperature":"2","unit":"C"},{"title":"Dec","rating":1,"wetsuit":1,"waterTemperature":"2","unit":"C"}],"description":"Maine gets the frontiersville tag if you're  looking at surfing north of Portland.

At Buxton, the recently relocated icon of the Cape Hatteras Lighthouse draws surfers like moths to a flame, and most surfers refer to the Outer Banks as 'Hatteras.' From Easter to Thanksgiving, this means crowds, particularly at the big-name spots. The sheep mentality is always a factor because for every quality peak with a crew at work on it, there is another, empty, quality peak a short walk north or south. This whole area is rife with good beachbreaks, and the only constraints are finding a place to park \u2013 unless you have a 4WD to disappear down the beach to your own private peak.\nOutside the Cape Hatteras National Seashore, the more developed Kitty Hawk to Nags Head coastal stretch is a stronghold of the East Coast surf industry. All the main players are represented by a plethora of surf shops, while the local pier waves provide a good proving ground for equipment testing by the large population of resident and transient surfers.\nThe southern half of North Carolina sweeps away to the southwest, increasing the width of the continental shelf and weakening the energy of the waves. Atlantic Beach and Emerald Isle face due south and, consequently, miss out on NE swells; but they light up when there is a good S or a hurricane swell. Access restrictions to a lot of pier-surf areas mean hassles, particularly in summer, but winter brings some good conditions, since the prevailing angle of the coast is perfect for offshores during winter nor'easters.\nWrightsville is one hotspot with punchy waves, where a dedicated crew of shredders competes with the crowds from the large campus at Wilmington.

Short, rocky platforms called 'fajas' are the dominant coastal feature, formed by either lava flowing into the sea or piles of rocks that have fallen from the sheer cliffs that rise up to 400m in places. Of the 46 fajas (30 on the north coast) only 5 are ever surfed regularly by the locals. There's little need to explore further as there are more waves in a 3km stretch than the small population of locals can handle. Faja dos Cubres has been touted as Portugal's longest wave yet it must be in close competition for the leg-burner crown with the Faja da Caldeira do Santo Cristo when it links up from the tip of Feiticeiras to the tail of Lago do Linho. These fajas work in all size swells and break with power over the boulders. One feature of the island's geology means a SW wind may be 35km\/h on the south coast but accelerates over the mid island ridge and descends at almost double that speed on the north side. W-NW winds can follow the cliffs cross-shore and basically behave in an erratic way. Faja dos Vimes is the only regular south coast option when SW swells and N winds combine. Like its neighbours, S\u00e3o Jorge is also a year-round proposition, handling the biggest winter swells but also picking up whatever is coming from the W to E swell window in summer. N winds are a bummer and exposes the island's lack of options, but the Cubres\/Sto Cristo area is often rideable in onshore conditions.\n","coordinates":{"lat":39.42,"lon":-31.26},"iso":"pt"},{"_id":289,"_obj":"SurfArea","_path":"SurfArea","url":"\/Terceira-Surfing\/289\/","name":"Terceira","countryId":106,"timezone":"Atlantic\/Azores","whenToGo":null,"pluses":["360\u00ba swell window\r\n\r\n\r\n","Epic Santa Catarina","Empty big wave spots","Beautiful landscapes","Eco-friendly environment"],"minuses":["Short-lived, disorganised swells\r\n\r\n","E-facing spots need big swells","Rapidly changing conditions","Heavy waves, rocks and boulders","Relatively expensive"],"monthInfo":[{"title":"Jan","rating":1,"wetsuit":5,"waterTemperature":"16","unit":"C"},{"title":"Feb","rating":1,"wetsuit":5,"waterTemperature":"16","unit":"C"},{"title":"Mar","rating":2,"wetsuit":5,"waterTemperature":"17","unit":"C"},{"title":"Apr","rating":2,"wetsuit":5,"waterTemperature":"17","unit":"C"},{"title":"May","rating":1,"wetsuit":5,"waterTemperature":"18","unit":"C"},{"title":"Jun","rating":0,"wetsuit":5,"waterTemperature":"18","unit":"C"},{"title":"Jul","rating":0,"wetsuit":null,"waterTemperature":"22","unit":"C"},{"title":"Aug","rating":1,"wetsuit":null,"waterTemperature":"22","unit":"C"},{"title":"Sep","rating":1,"wetsuit":null,"waterTemperature":"22","unit":"C"},{"title":"Oct","rating":2,"wetsuit":null,"waterTemperature":"22","unit":"C"},{"title":"Nov","rating":2,"wetsuit":5,"waterTemperature":"19","unit":"C"},{"title":"Dec","rating":1,"wetsuit":5,"waterTemperature":"19","unit":"C"}],"description":"Terceira simply means the third island but some of its waves are first class.

Bodega Bay is generally affluent, and the Russian River Valley is a western gateway to world-renowned wine country. Unfortunately, the surf in Sonoma doesn't compare to the quality of its vintages. While the numerous rocky coves are beautiful beyond scenic, most of the Sonoma coast is inaccessible or does not break at all due to deep water and sheer cliffs.\n There are only four towns on the Sonoma coast, and between them lie miles and miles of inaccessible or unsurfable beaches. There may be a real jewel or two, but these are only scored by the locals. The best spots are few and far between, so most surfers tend to congregate at all the same places. Salmon Creek is the county's best-known spot, while south-facing Doran Park is favored by beginners and anybody else looking for some relief from the persistent NW winds. For the traveler, a number of spots will be obvious, but finding the sublime will require some very open locals to point you in the right direction, since the forests and abundant steep cliffs lining Highway 1 do hide a few secrets.\nWinter swells are relentless and lumpy, colliding violently with Sonoma's ragged coastline, deeming the surfable spots few and far between. NW swell is the predominant direction, as are NW winds. Storms bring SE winds \u2013 blowing offshore at a few select spots. South and due west swells are uncommon. The reefs are very tidally sensitive and fickle. The beachbreaks like Salmon Creek are very consistent but often junky, and it's difficult or impossible to make it out when there's a solid swell or even windswell. Many of the beachbreaks come up from deep water to throw treacherous shorepounds and don't  break on small swells. Beware of brutal currents. Beginners will be most at home at Doran Park than anywhere else in the county thanks to its shallow, more graduated bottom and wind protection.\n","coordinates":{"lat":38.6087,"lon":-123.368},"iso":"us"},{"_id":292,"_obj":"SurfArea","_path":"SurfArea","url":"\/South-Carolina-South-Surfing\/292\/","name":"South Carolina - South","countryId":39,"timezone":"America\/New_York","whenToGo":null,"pluses":[],"minuses":[],"monthInfo":[{"title":"Jan","rating":1,"wetsuit":2,"waterTemperature":"10","unit":"C"},{"title":"Feb","rating":1,"wetsuit":2,"waterTemperature":"10","unit":"C"},{"title":"Mar","rating":1,"wetsuit":5,"waterTemperature":"16","unit":"C"},{"title":"Apr","rating":2,"wetsuit":5,"waterTemperature":"16","unit":"C"},{"title":"May","rating":1,"wetsuit":8,"waterTemperature":"24","unit":"C"},{"title":"Jun","rating":0,"wetsuit":8,"waterTemperature":"24","unit":"C"},{"title":"Jul","rating":0,"wetsuit":8,"waterTemperature":"28","unit":"C"},{"title":"Aug","rating":0,"wetsuit":8,"waterTemperature":"28","unit":"C"},{"title":"Sep","rating":1,"wetsuit":8,"waterTemperature":"24","unit":"C"},{"title":"Oct","rating":2,"wetsuit":8,"waterTemperature":"24","unit":"C"},{"title":"Nov","rating":2,"wetsuit":5,"waterTemperature":"15","unit":"C"},{"title":"Dec","rating":1,"wetsuit":5,"waterTemperature":"15","unit":"C"}],"description":"South Carolina is afflicted by the vast, gently sloping, shallow continental shelf, which causes the incoming swell to drag, reducing the power of the waves.

Expect very little in the way of the 'true Baja' experience here; instead, it's easy road access and mass tourism with crowded waves at a variety of good breaks. Beyond the average beachbreaks of Playas de Tijuana and the subsequent private condo developments, Baja Malibu is a powerful and consistent peaky beachbreak that takes any swell from S to NW and is best from low to mid tide. It's very easy to find and will always be crowded. Rosarito, a few miles further south, has a long stretch of exposed beachbreak scattered with reefs and rivermouths. It's a crowded party town and has good facilities, including a surf shop and a hospital, but the water can be polluted.\nDistance markers in kilometers are used to name breaks like K-38 and K-38.5 which get California-crowded thanks to easy access and quality waves. These spots break year-round; they work best on a S but will handle a big W or NW. Spots like K-40, Las Gaviotas, Raul's, and others offer above-average waves, but can get crowded too. Campo Lopez (K-55) is known for powerful, tubing beach peaks with some lefts off the rocks; very consistent, but new development will severely restrict access. La Fonda (K-58) has good rivermouth-fed sandbars that keep the beachbreak waves hollow and punchy. Salsipuedes (reef) and San Miguel (slick cobble) are legendary Baja right pointbreaks. The area has some sharky breaks, like 3M's, near the canneries and fish-processing plant. The metropolis of Ensenada is the jumping-off point for Baja's most famous wave, Killers, which bombs onto the reefs off Islas de Todos Santos 20km (12mi) offshore. This is a world-class big-wave spot where any available winter swell is focused and magnified. (Rental boats are available from Ensenada; 6 people with guns for $100). \nSouth of Ensenada, true Baja surf missions begin where the highway leaves the coast and strays into the beautiful and barren inland. There's still plenty in the way of 'civilization' all the way past San Quintin and on to El Rosario, which is sort of a halfway house between the crowded tourist reality north of Ensenada and the remote and challenging country below El Rosario, where the winds get stronger, the water gets colder, and the waves are less crowded away from the well-known spots.\nPast Ensenada and the military checkpoint at Maneadero is the little village of Santo Tomas. Head west from here along one of the unpaved tracks and you'll  arrive at Punta San Jose or Punta Cabras. Both have great point, reef, and beachbreak waves, and the kelp helps keep 'em glassy in this wind-challenged area, but they're  only five hours or so from the border, so they can be jammed with San Diego weekend warriors. There's a rare signed and paved road that leads straight to the reefs and beaches of K-181 and the well-stocked town of Erendira. Access south of there gets difficult until San Telmo de Abajo signals a string of kelpy, righthand points from Cabo Colonet down to Punta Camalu. Name breaks like Quatro Casas (Punta San Telmo) are often crowded with longboarders who relish the forgiving waves and camping scene overlooking the break.

Problems with tough access and strong NW winds are offset by minimal crowds and great sportfishing.

However, there are some interesting spots around the Delta, and there are surfers in both states. 'The Delta area was very complicated,' Bryson Williamson summarizes. At the height of the '60s surf craze, Williamson opened a BJ's Surf Shop in Houma and sponsored a Louisiana surf team. They surfed Grand Isle, Holly Beach near Lake Charles, and the bayou La Fouce.\nThe islands around the Mississippi Delta do intercept some swell, and there are some point breaks that can be quite good by Gulf standards. They are difficult to access, however \u2013 most only by boat, and few even know of their existence. The most telling factoid for the lack of surf is a glance at pilot charts, which indicate a water depth of less than 35ft (11m) extending for miles offshore. This reflects eons of silting from the vast heartland drainage system that feeds into the Mississippi River, which has choked the muddied waters for miles around the river's delta.\nRumors of waves on offshore sandbanks out on the Mississippi Delta can't  be discounted, and the Port Fourchon to Grand Isle stretch near the East Bay Peninsula may hold surf since it protrudes towards deeper water. On the whole, however, Louisiana and Mississippi are unlikely to deliver if it's surf you're  lookin' for.\nALABAMA\nAlabama's slim 50 miles (80km) of swell exposure is wedged between the worst and one of the best surfing areas on the Gulf Coast. Generally, it's more like the former. Split by Mobile Bay into two areas of possibility, Alabama needs hurricanes or SE windswell for any sort of wave action. Breaks on the skinny, sandy strip of Dauphin Island tend to be weaker and less organized, but the surf spots between Fort Morgan and the Florida state line provide the best chance of rideable waves. There is little argument among the locals that when it's good here, Florida is probably better! Still, there has been an Alabama State Championships held at State Pier in the past (won by Sammy Owen in '69), so there are definitely surfers here and surf to be had.\n\n","coordinates":{"lat":30.38,"lon":-86.86},"iso":"us"},{"_id":298,"_obj":"SurfArea","_path":"SurfArea","url":"\/Florida-Gulf-Coast-Surfing\/298\/","name":"Florida Gulf Coast","countryId":5,"timezone":"America\/New_York","whenToGo":null,"pluses":[],"minuses":[],"monthInfo":[{"title":"Jan","wetsuit":null,"waterTemperature":"20","unit":"C"},{"title":"Feb","wetsuit":null,"waterTemperature":"20","unit":"C"},{"title":"Mar","wetsuit":8,"waterTemperature":"24","unit":"C"},{"title":"Apr","wetsuit":8,"waterTemperature":"24","unit":"C"},{"title":"May","wetsuit":8,"waterTemperature":"28","unit":"C"},{"title":"Jun","wetsuit":8,"waterTemperature":"28","unit":"C"},{"title":"Jul","wetsuit":8,"waterTemperature":"30","unit":"C"},{"title":"Aug","wetsuit":8,"waterTemperature":"30","unit":"C"},{"title":"Sep","wetsuit":8,"waterTemperature":"29","unit":"C"},{"title":"Oct","wetsuit":8,"waterTemperature":"29","unit":"C"},{"title":"Nov","wetsuit":null,"waterTemperature":"23","unit":"C"},{"title":"Dec","wetsuit":null,"waterTemperature":"23","unit":"C"}],"description":"There are two distinct areas to Florida's Gulf Coast, separated by geography and also wave size. The term 'panhandle' is used to describe a narrow strip of land that projects from one state into another; this basically describes Florida's northwest territory, which extends along the Gulf shore beneath Alabama and Georgia. Directly offshore from Pensacola, the swell-sapping continental shelf is at its narrowest, providing a welcome focus for wave oscillations in the eastern Gulf. Strangely, there is enough fetch for E wind swells to be produced, adding to the usual SE windchop, but SW to W swells have a lot of trouble getting over the shallow delta at the mouth of the Mississippi. But if a tropical storm enters the area from the S, the Panhandle will pump with double overhead and even larger waves, although swell duration can be extremely short. Winter is the time when the E-SE winds blow hardest before a cold front sweeps in from the NW bringing offshore winds and powerful, precipitous waves from Pensacola to Panama City.\nPensacola has miles of glaringly white, sandy beaches. Here the waves conform to the 'crumbly outside wall reforming into steeper inside shorebreak' category. However, this trend is bucked by a precious few waves at the barrier island extremities where inlet jetties provide foundations for solid, quality breaks. Furthest west are the lefts of The Point at Fort Pickens, which need a sizable swell to wrap around into the sheltered bay. Sand formation is crucial and, while hurricanes bring swell, they also destroy sandbars or rearrange them in all the wrong places, making this sand bottomed pointbreak very fickle indeed.\nPensacola Beach has plenty of uninterrupted beachbreaks leading east along Santa Rosa Island to Navarre. Here a new pier provides constant banks from the outside to the steeper shorebreak, without the crowds of the nearby cities.\nFort Walton Beach and Destin present welcome variations from straight, open beaches; here, inlet jetties form wedging waves, which help shape consistent spots like NCOs and Jetty East. The shoreline from Destin to Sandestin offers miles of featureless peaks to choose from, and the Henderson Beach State Park is a nice respite from shoreline development. Grayton Beach State Park is a cheap camping option in otherwise expensive surroundings with proximity to some above-average sandbars.\nHeading east into the popular college town\/tourist destination of Panama City, look for more crowds, especially at the two piers. The concrete one is more consistent with better banks that can connect all the way from the outside through to the steeper shorebreak; the wooden pier is a less crowded, if humbler, option. Three of the best waves on the Panhandle are clustered at the southeastern end of Panama Beach. Long jetties protect the deep inlet between St Andrews State Park and Shell Island, both of which offer hard-breaking peaks with good wind protection. But the real gem is situated inside the inlet on the western side of the eastern jetty. Amazons is a long, workable lefthander that needs a decent SE or E swell to break. Handles the big stuff, but access is tricky without a boat, as paddling across the inlet is dangerous due to tidal currents, boat traffic, sharks, and zealous, ticket-writing Coastguard officials. Military bases and difficult access compound the situation, making it difficult to surf any further east.\nSurfing opportunities all but disappear along the 250-mile (400km) stretch between Cape St George to Clearwater, as impenetrable marshlands exclude access, and broad, shallow offshore shoals dampen all swell activity. There aren't  many waves along the heavily-populated east coast of the Florida Peninsula from Tampa south to Naples. Swells are rare, and rideable shape even rarer.\nThe 'Sun Coast', from Clearwater down to the entrance to Tampa Bay, is worse off than more southern areas because of shorter fetches on N swells and more extensive offshore shoals. Sandwiched between the ultra-developed, surfer-restricted stretch of Clearwater Beach and the ultra-protective, elite-residential beachbreaks of Belleair is a single inlet jetty that has recently lifted its ban on surfing. When lifeguards deem it good enough, Sand Key produces longer than average righthanders when a NW swell wraps around the jetty. Indian Rocks to Indian Shores curves enough to give options depending on swell direction, and most of the beachbreaks peak up and pitch close to shore. From Reddington Shores to St Pete, jetties are the focus for more hollow shorebreaks.\nSouth of Tampa Bay the offshore waters deepen and the waves grow accordingly. Anna Maria Key is a pier hotspot boasting outside and inside sandbars that will produce on any swell direction, size, or tide. Holmes Beach Pier and the misnomered Twin Piers (there are 3 structures) at Bradenton Beach are regularly crowded, but nearby open beach can hold surprisingly punchy peaks. The next key down, Siesta, needs summer S or W swells as it is protected from the N swells and winds, but nearby Turtle Beach works on winter NW'ers.\nJust south of Sarasota, Venice Beach is generally considered Spot X on the Gulf Coast \u2013 subject to heavy crowds in heavy swells. The North and South Inlet Jetties are swell magnets, bending in serious waves at whichever one is opposed to the swell direction. The crowds are still apparent at nearby Venice Pier but recede at the beachbreaks that extend south past Englewood. Boca Grande is the beginning of the end for easy access (without a boat or surplus money to book in at one of the exclusive island resorts). The last-chance surf at Naples Pier provides sandbars on either side, and there are a couple of jetty breaks to the north, but geographically and metaphorically speaking, Naples is the last resort on the Gulf Coast.\nBeyond Naples and Marco Island, the beaches of the Everglades don't  offer much; for swells to reach this southern Gulf Coast, they have to come from the NW \u2013 usually courtesy of winter cold fronts. This means short fetches, onshore winds, and a fleeting lifespan. The rest of the year is even more dubious, as the best you can expect is below-waist windswell junk for desperate longboarding, or the rare hurricane that takes off on the right track to send generous swells back in the opposite direction of their line of travel, bringing genuine SW swells to this tropical corner of the 48 States.\n","coordinates":{"lat":27.1,"lon":-82.46},"iso":"us"},{"_id":299,"_obj":"SurfArea","_path":"SurfArea","url":"\/Lake-Superior-Surfing\/299\/","name":"Lake Superior","countryId":143,"timezone":"America\/Chicago","whenToGo":null,"pluses":["Unique freshwater experience\r\n\r\n\r\n","Rare crowds","Quality surf possible","Inland surf culture","Great local camaraderie"],"minuses":["Inconsistent\r\n\r\n","Long drives required","Ice and thick rubber","Pollution","Private access to some break"],"monthInfo":[{"title":"Jan","rating":1,"wetsuit":1,"waterTemperature":"2","unit":"C"},{"title":"Feb","rating":1,"wetsuit":1,"waterTemperature":"2","unit":"C"},{"title":"Mar","rating":1,"wetsuit":1,"waterTemperature":"2","unit":"C"},{"title":"Apr","rating":2,"wetsuit":1,"waterTemperature":"2","unit":"C"},{"title":"May","rating":1,"wetsuit":1,"waterTemperature":"4","unit":"C"},{"title":"Jun","rating":0,"wetsuit":1,"waterTemperature":"4","unit":"C"},{"title":"Jul","rating":0,"wetsuit":4,"waterTemperature":"13","unit":"C"},{"title":"Aug","rating":0,"wetsuit":4,"waterTemperature":"13","unit":"C"},{"title":"Sep","rating":1,"wetsuit":5,"waterTemperature":"17","unit":"C"},{"title":"Oct","rating":2,"wetsuit":5,"waterTemperature":"17","unit":"C"},{"title":"Nov","rating":2,"wetsuit":2,"waterTemperature":"7","unit":"C"},{"title":"Dec","rating":1,"wetsuit":2,"waterTemperature":"7","unit":"C"}],"description":"Glaciers gouged out the 5 Great Lakes, creating the biggest lake system on the planet, containing 6 quadrillion gallons, or one fifth of the world's freshwater supplies.

Just north of the Orinoco river delta in Venezuela, Trinidad is largely flat or undulating, ascending to a height of 940m (3084ft) in the Northern Range. Trinidad possesses sizable oil, gas and asphalt reserves, and its prosperity is linked directly to the production of petroleum and petrochemicals. The main surfing areas are situated in the north and north-east of the island near Toco, which is too far for a day-trip from Port-Of-Spain, but there is still a huge amount of coast line unexplored by surfers. Two thirds of Tobago is volcanic and mountainous, rising sharply in the east under a dense cloak of tropical rain forest, while the flatter, drier western side offers the nicest beaches. This southwest coast is where all the surf spots are located with the exception of Crazy's. The Buccoo Reef National Park is the main coastal feature, offering not only great surf but also fantastic snorkelling and diving. \n\n","coordinates":{"lat":10.7195,"lon":-60.9852},"iso":"tt"},{"_id":308,"_obj":"SurfArea","_path":"SurfArea","url":"\/Southwest-Black-Sea-Surfing\/308\/","name":"Southwest Black Sea","countryId":204,"timezone":"Europe\/Istanbul","whenToGo":null,"pluses":["2 different swell directions","No tides","Totally virgin ","Scenic coastal road","Istanbul, culture and snow resorts"],"minuses":["Inconsistent, short-lived swells","Gutless small waves","Cold and wet winter climate","Long drives","Lack of tourist infrastructure"],"monthInfo":[{"title":"Jan","rating":1,"wetsuit":2,"waterTemperature":"7","unit":"C"},{"title":"Feb","rating":1,"wetsuit":2,"waterTemperature":"7","unit":"C"},{"title":"Mar","rating":1,"wetsuit":2,"waterTemperature":"9","unit":"C"},{"title":"Apr","rating":0,"wetsuit":2,"waterTemperature":"9","unit":"C"},{"title":"May","rating":0,"wetsuit":5,"waterTemperature":"17","unit":"C"},{"title":"Jun","rating":0,"wetsuit":5,"waterTemperature":"17","unit":"C"},{"title":"Jul","rating":0,"wetsuit":8,"waterTemperature":"24","unit":"C"},{"title":"Aug","rating":0,"wetsuit":8,"waterTemperature":"24","unit":"C"},{"title":"Sep","rating":1,"wetsuit":null,"waterTemperature":"20","unit":"C"},{"title":"Oct","rating":2,"wetsuit":null,"waterTemperature":"20","unit":"C"},{"title":"Nov","rating":2,"wetsuit":4,"waterTemperature":"13","unit":"C"},{"title":"Dec","rating":1,"wetsuit":4,"waterTemperature":"13","unit":"C"}],"description":"The Black Sea is encircled by Bulgaria, Ukraine, Russia, Georgia and Turkey, with Istanbul straddling the narrow Bosphorus strait and therefore both the continents of Europe and Asia.

Fortunately, northern Cuba also has another source of surf, the big storms that reliably churn out of the Gulf of Mexico and send stormy swell marching towards the north western corner of the island, around Havana.

Intense guerrilla activity, high street-crime statistics, and a heavy drug trade have served to keep Colombia off the radar for most surfers. Beyond these discouraging factors, most of the breaks are difficult to access. Pacific Colombia is one of the wettest shores in the world, receiving 5m (200in) of rain per year, meaning much of Choco Province has no roads. Getting there entails flying in, and getting around requires navigating the myriad of waterways. The Nuqui area receives long-distance swell from all over the Pacific, the direction of which dictates the best break on the day. Most visitors fly into Bogot\u00e1 and Medellin, then take a small plane to Nuqui. There are breaks within walking distance from El Cantil Ecolodge, generally regarded as the best base for a surf mission. The beaches local to the lodge are average, however, and the best way of accessing many of the better waves in the region is by powerboat. To make it economical, a group of four is ideal to hire a boat and explore.

It is a wonder that has never been truly understood, even though predicting a bore wave's arrival and size is fairly easy. Unlike ocean waves, the bore has two currents: one at the top pushing ahead and another one below from the downstream river flow. At times, the mighty bore has wreaked great havoc on riverside infrastructure and last century several majestic bores were stripped of their power by human intervention. The word pororoca comes from poroc poroc, which means destroyer, big-bang, in the regional aboriginal dialect and the phenomenon was first shown on Brazilian TV after Jacques Cousteau aboard the Calypso first shot the phenomenon on the 28th March, 1982. It was breaking 15km (9mi) out to sea, outside the Araguari rivermouth, at about 10ft (3m) high and going 45 km\/h (30mp\/h), before they   followed the bore 25km (15mi) upstream. In 1997, a country known for small waves became the Hawaii of the bore-riders with pioneers like Noelio Sobrinho, Guga Arruda and Eraldo Gueiros taking on the pororocas. The huge Amazon basin fed by a dozen rivers proves to hold the longest rideable waves on earth and in April, 2003, an unofficial world record was set. Picuruta Salazar managed to ride the bore for 37 minutes and travel 12.5km (7.8mi) before Serginho Laus, on 24th June 2005, and in the presence of an official Guinness adjudicator set the new distance surfing world record with a 33 minute ride of 10.1km (6.3mi). Since 1999, an annual championship has been held in S\u00e3o Domingos do Capim and there is now frequent events on Rio Araguari or Rio Mearim.

Unfortunately, Sri Lanka is still being shaped by two modern catastrophic events: the civil war, which has been raging since 1983 (64,000 deaths) and the 2004 tsunami (3,000 deaths). For centuries, the Tamils have been claiming the north and eastern part of the island for the Sinhalese people and most of the bombings are aimed at government targets in northern Jaffna or Colombo, however, in September 2006, local unrest between Pottuville residents and security forces, sadly spilled over into peaceful Arugam Bay. An exodus of visitors followed and resulted in a travel warning. First surfed in 1964, Arugam Bay is no longer a surf secret, but on 26th December 2004, it was almost erased off the surfing map by the Boxing Day tsunami. The three waves, estimated to be 45ft (13m) high, struck this region with apocalyptic force, flattening the fishing villages, the beachside hotels and restaurants and destroying 80% of Sri Lanka's entire fishing fleet. Despite this disaster, the waves are still breaking, better than ever, with consistently small, perfect righthand peelers, that make Arugam Bay an intermediates heaven. Arugam Bay (the 7 villages) is often compared to Kuta, Bali in the late '70s to early '80s, before the major developments and the civil war has contributed to keeping the village in its most basic form. A-Bay is the focus, despite difficult access via a narrow bridge and checkpoint, but there seems an endless supply of sheltered sand-bottom pointbreaks along this southeastern coast.\n\n","coordinates":{"lat":6.8382,"lon":81.8407},"iso":"lk"},{"_id":328,"_obj":"SurfArea","_path":"SurfArea","url":"\/Northwest-Liberia-Surfing\/328\/","name":"Northwest Liberia","countryId":169,"timezone":"Africa\/Abidjan","whenToGo":null,"pluses":["Fairly consistent SW swells\r\n\r\n","Virgin warm water surf","Best left pointbreaks in Africa","Not too challenging","Robertsport proximity to Monrovia"],"minuses":["Inconsistent in summer\r\n\r\n","Extremely wet during surf season","Average beachbreaks","Bugs, malaria, yellow fever","Relatively high costs"],"monthInfo":[{"title":"Jan","rating":0,"wetsuit":8,"waterTemperature":"27","unit":"C"},{"title":"Feb","rating":0,"wetsuit":8,"waterTemperature":"27","unit":"C"},{"title":"Mar","rating":1,"wetsuit":8,"waterTemperature":"27","unit":"C"},{"title":"Apr","rating":2,"wetsuit":8,"waterTemperature":"27","unit":"C"},{"title":"May","rating":2,"wetsuit":8,"waterTemperature":"28","unit":"C"},{"title":"Jun","rating":1,"wetsuit":8,"waterTemperature":"28","unit":"C"},{"title":"Jul","rating":1,"wetsuit":8,"waterTemperature":"26","unit":"C"},{"title":"Aug","rating":2,"wetsuit":8,"waterTemperature":"26","unit":"C"},{"title":"Sep","rating":1,"wetsuit":8,"waterTemperature":"27","unit":"C"},{"title":"Oct","rating":1,"wetsuit":8,"waterTemperature":"27","unit":"C"},{"title":"Nov","rating":0,"wetsuit":8,"waterTemperature":"28","unit":"C"},{"title":"Dec","rating":0,"wetsuit":8,"waterTemperature":"28","unit":"C"}],"description":"The name Liberia comes from the word liberty and refers to the nation's origin as a colony of freed African American slaves returning to Africa from the United States in the early 19th century. Formerly known as the Grain Coast after the melegueta pepper that was the primary export, these days it's valued for the tropical rainforest containing exotic hardwoods and mountain ranges in the northern region which are rich in iron ore, gold, and diamonds. Since 1989, two civil wars have plunged the country into chaos, led by violent military dictatorships, leading to the deaths of up to 200,000 people. Liberia is now on the road to recovery after UN and West African peace-keepers intervened and democratic elections voted in Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, the first African female head of state in 2005.

The height of the wave at source was a staggering 690ft (210m), and by the time it hit Crete, nearly 120km (75mi) away,  it was still around 200ft (60m) high, wiping the Minoan's coastal towns from the map and sinking their large fleet without trace. These days, the Greek-owned fleet is the largest in the world and their affinity with the sea is now extending to surfing. With slightly more than 1000 islands, the Greek coastline is split between 4,000km (2,485mi) of mainland and 10,000km (6213mi) of islands. The large, southern island of Crete, would seem to have the best swell exposure, but underwater topography is not that great and spots are far from each other. The countless Greek islands of the Aegean Sea experience a strong N wind known as the 'Meltemi' in summer, whipping up many rideable waves on islands like Chis, Kos, Naxos, Rhodos or Thinos. From Athens, it's a straight shot to Peloponisos, which is exposed on both sides. However, it's the coast of Epirus, right below Albania, that gets both S swells from the Ionian Sea as well as NW swells from the southern Adriatic Sea, which combined with the highest density of quality surf spots, make this region Greek surf central. In 2005, Surfing Magazine published Poseidon Adventure: A Greek Surf Odyssey with Joe Curren, Mike Todd and Ben Bourgeois showcasing the surf potential. Italian and French surfers are starting to make the trip there when winter storms coincide with cheap air tickets, joining the growing number of locals riding some decent quality lefts.","coordinates":{"lat":37.8129,"lon":23.7781},"iso":"gr"},{"_id":335,"_obj":"SurfArea","_path":"SurfArea","url":"\/Eastern-Peninsular-Surfing\/335\/","name":"Eastern Peninsular","countryId":139,"timezone":"Asia\/Bangkok","whenToGo":null,"pluses":["Frequent NE monsoon swells\r\n\r\n","Plenty of mellow beachbreaks","Small and friendly local surf population","Cheap and safe country","Good tourist infrastructure"],"minuses":["Short swell season\r\n","Mainly messy windswell","Lack of reefbreaks","Murky monsoon waters","Rainy swell season"],"monthInfo":[{"title":"Jan","rating":2,"wetsuit":8,"waterTemperature":"29","unit":"C"},{"title":"Feb","rating":2,"wetsuit":8,"waterTemperature":"29","unit":"C"},{"title":"Mar","rating":1,"wetsuit":8,"waterTemperature":"31","unit":"C"},{"title":"Apr","rating":0,"wetsuit":8,"waterTemperature":"31","unit":"C"},{"title":"May","rating":0,"wetsuit":8,"waterTemperature":"31","unit":"C"},{"title":"Jun","rating":0,"wetsuit":8,"waterTemperature":"31","unit":"C"},{"title":"Jul","rating":0,"wetsuit":8,"waterTemperature":"29","unit":"C"},{"title":"Aug","rating":0,"wetsuit":8,"waterTemperature":"29","unit":"C"},{"title":"Sep","rating":0,"wetsuit":8,"waterTemperature":"28","unit":"C"},{"title":"Oct","rating":1,"wetsuit":8,"waterTemperature":"28","unit":"C"},{"title":"Nov","rating":2,"wetsuit":8,"waterTemperature":"27","unit":"C"},{"title":"Dec","rating":2,"wetsuit":8,"waterTemperature":"27","unit":"C"}],"description":"Malaysia is made up of Peninsular Malaysia and East Malaysia located on the northern part of Borneo island, which the Indonesians now call Kalimantan.

These exposed beachbreaks seemingly work best in the early monsoon season, when the sand bars have built up during flat summers. The weirdest fact about Malaysian locals is that most of them have learned to surf at Sunway Lagoon, a wave pool in a major water-park west of Kuala Lumpur.

Sunway Lagoon can be found in Petalin Jaya, between the airport and KL. No personal or fibreglass boards are allowed, you can only ride softboards and it only opens on the weekend, when they alternate 1h for bodyboards and 1h for surfboards. It costs $8 for entry plus $7 for board rental. Quiksilver organizes an international contest on December 31st and in 2003, Indonesians won the event boosting airs and tail slides and the pool got pretty popular after many pros did jet ski tow-ins. \n\n","coordinates":{"lat":4.1238,"lon":103.397},"iso":"my"},{"_id":336,"_obj":"SurfArea","_path":"SurfArea","url":"\/Vancouver-Island-Surfing\/336\/","name":"Vancouver Island","countryId":25,"timezone":"America\/Vancouver","whenToGo":null,"pluses":["Consistent swells \r\n\r\n","Mix of beaches, reefs and points","Waves for all abilities ","Wildlife","Luxury lodge options"],"minuses":["Messy stormy swells\r\n","Beaches often onshore","Expensive local costs","Rare, localised pointbreaks","Cold and super rainy"],"monthInfo":[{"title":"Jan","rating":0,"wetsuit":2,"waterTemperature":"7","unit":"C"},{"title":"Feb","rating":0,"wetsuit":2,"waterTemperature":"7","unit":"C"},{"title":"Mar","rating":1,"wetsuit":2,"waterTemperature":"9","unit":"C"},{"title":"Apr","rating":1,"wetsuit":2,"waterTemperature":"9","unit":"C"},{"title":"May","rating":2,"wetsuit":4,"waterTemperature":"11","unit":"C"},{"title":"Jun","rating":1,"wetsuit":4,"waterTemperature":"11","unit":"C"},{"title":"Jul","rating":1,"wetsuit":5,"waterTemperature":"15","unit":"C"},{"title":"Aug","rating":1,"wetsuit":5,"waterTemperature":"15","unit":"C"},{"title":"Sep","rating":2,"wetsuit":4,"waterTemperature":"14","unit":"C"},{"title":"Oct","rating":2,"wetsuit":4,"waterTemperature":"14","unit":"C"},{"title":"Nov","rating":1,"wetsuit":4,"waterTemperature":"10","unit":"C"},{"title":"Dec","rating":0,"wetsuit":4,"waterTemperature":"10","unit":"C"}],"description":"Canada has the world's longest coastline and with 52,455 islands, it should also host the largest number of surf spots.

So far, surfers have been exploring the southern corners of this vast country, finding Nova Scotia on the eastern seaboard and Vancouver Island to the west well endowed with some quality reefs, points and beaches. Literally hundreds of spots exist along the remote nooks and crannies of Vancouver Island, but access is challenging without a boat or seaplane, which is how the experts like Tatchu Surf Adventures manage to get surfers to the northern areas of the Brooks Peninsula, Nootka Island and the Hesquiat Peninsula. There is, however, 2 areas of easy road access to the surf at Tofino and inside the Strait of Juan de Fuca. Blessed with some reliable beachbreaks, Tofino is the closest thing to a surf town on the west coast and is home to about 1,700 friendly residents who have embraced high-end ecotourism with luxurious amenities. Points and reefs are a feature of the stretch inside the Strait, coming to life with strong winter swells. Stunning old-growth temperate rainforests provide the backdrop to the breathtaking beaches. In recent years, locals like Peter Devries and the Bruhwiler brothers have proved that you can do all the warm water tricks in full winter kit, prompting more people each year to don some rubber and hit the waves in this spectacular natural environment.\n\n","coordinates":{"lat":49.0622,"lon":-125.7499},"iso":"ca"},{"_id":337,"_obj":"SurfArea","_path":"SurfArea","url":"\/Malta-Gozo-Surfing\/337\/","name":"Malta & Gozo","countryId":0,"timezone":"","whenToGo":null,"pluses":["NW and NE swells \r\n\r\n","Quality reefs and beaches","No crowds","No tides","Architecture, history & scuba diving"],"minuses":["Winter only\r\n\r\n","Lack of consistent spots","Coastline cliffs","Jellyfish & shallow rocks","Urban sprawl & mad traffic"],"monthInfo":[{"title":"Jan","rating":2,"wetsuit":5,"waterTemperature":"15","unit":"C"},{"title":"Feb","rating":2,"wetsuit":5,"waterTemperature":"15","unit":"C"},{"title":"Mar","rating":1,"wetsuit":5,"waterTemperature":"16","unit":"C"},{"title":"Apr","rating":0,"wetsuit":5,"waterTemperature":"16","unit":"C"},{"title":"May","rating":0,"wetsuit":null,"waterTemperature":"20","unit":"C"},{"title":"Jun","rating":0,"wetsuit":null,"waterTemperature":"20","unit":"C"},{"title":"Jul","rating":0,"wetsuit":8,"waterTemperature":"25","unit":"C"},{"title":"Aug","rating":0,"wetsuit":8,"waterTemperature":"25","unit":"C"},{"title":"Sep","rating":0,"wetsuit":null,"waterTemperature":"23","unit":"C"},{"title":"Oct","rating":1,"wetsuit":null,"waterTemperature":"23","unit":"C"},{"title":"Nov","rating":2,"wetsuit":5,"waterTemperature":"18","unit":"C"},{"title":"Dec","rating":2,"wetsuit":5,"waterTemperature":"18","unit":"C"}],"description":"The southernmost limit of the European Community sits in the middle of the Mediterranean Sea, where it has withstood a pounding from millennia of Mistral or Grecale wind-driven waves.

The many rocky inlets make perfect natural harbours to tap the bountiful maritime resources and the soft, golden rock, known as tuff, has been shaped into many caves, making easy homes for both cave dwellers and skilled builders. Malta & Gozo have an incredible history, with megalithic evidence as old as 5000 BC, about 1000 years before Stonehenge and a constant trail of invasions including the middle-age crusaders, British colonial rule and finally independence in 1964.

Unfortunately, it's got the 2nd highest density of cars after the USA, so expect some traffic and dangerous, erratic driving from the locals. Winter is the ideal time to go, not only to avoid the mad crowds of summer, but because this is the best timing for the NW-NE swells.

Swells are surprisingly consistent, although wave quality suffers because there's so much shallow nearshore water, endless sands and frequent onshores during the SW monsoon, which coincides with the swell season. There is undoubtedly potential for decent size beachbreaks and some smaller, playful pointbreaks, which are always bigger than the east coast, but never as clean.  That's why the combination of Kerala, the southernmost tip of India and Tamil Nadu on the southeast-facing coast, provide the flexibility to score good waves year-round, with no crowds at all. Trivandrum is the most convenient town to the southern tip, but good waves can be found all the way up towards Goa through Northern Kerala at places like Mah\u00e9, which has been surfed since the '70s, or spots like Madayi Point and Talakkolattur rivermouth. Further north is Bekal Fort with reliable rights, before arriving in Karnataka state, where there are more quality beaches ridden by a small community of surfers located north of Mangalore.

Being the gateway to the Sunshine Coast and the Wild Coast, East London  is a major hub for the region and attracts the adventurous and sporting to many international events. What isn't  so obvious is the fact that East London is one of the best areas in SA to visit & surf. Since 1847, about 150 ships have been wrecked within a 5km radius of the Buffalo Harbour, the reason being that swells hitting the Eastern Cape are the most consistent for the whole South African coastline. Considering the warmer water and the number of legitimate right pointbreaks which have nurtured surfers like Greg Emslie or Nikita Robb, East London is a world-class zone that sharks have managed to keep quiet. To date, 20 shark attacks have been recorded in the past 18 years around East London. The worst incident was in 1994 when top local surfer Bruce Corby died as a result of his injuries from a great white, right after Andrew Carter was attacked but survived. In July 2000, 15-year-old Shannon Ainslie was targeted by two massive great whites and you can view the attack on Surfer Mag (or youtube). At Gonubie Point, Anton Devos was killed by a great white while bodyboarding in 2004. Then in November 2007, local Lee Mellin, survived an attack at Bonza Bay by a monster shark, which left a 38 cm wound down his thigh. Locals advise not to enter the water in the early morning or late afternoon, when birds and dolphins are seen feeding, and on no account to go out alone.

Given the opportunity, this beautiful country could be a main tourist destination in Asia, thanks to its plentiful supply of natural resources, but it has never had much of a chance under the repression of the State Peace and Development Council (SPDC). This military led dictatorship has re-christened the country Myanmar, but despite being the biggest geographical area in SE Asia, many western governments refuse to recognise the new name and continue to use Burma. Regardless of what you call it, the biggest obstacle to travelling to and experiencing this fabulously exotic culture is one of conscience. Tourism is in it's infancy and the government controls almost all facets, which often have a very negative impact on the local population. Displacing villagers to build new hotels in prime locations is an obvious consequence, but behind the scenes, it is claimed that the Burmese tourist industry is built on slave labour, funded by illegal heroin and jade mining. Villagers are given little choice in the matter and human rights abuses are common, so most western governments advise their nationals not to visit or invest in Myanmar. If visiting Burma, it is almost impossible to avoid financing the military junta, therefore enabling them to continue to suppress the Burmese people. Even the imprisoned leader of the opposition party implores foreign tourists to stay away, so we are publishing this information from an education and 'what could be' standpoint, in the hope the political situation improves.

It's probably easier to fly to the Dominican Rep. and connect overland to Haiti's north coast where shallow reefs greet the winter NE swells. It really takes real determination to check Haiti's empty surf since economically, the country has become the poorest nation in the northern hemisphere. Being the first and only successful slave revolt leading to free nationhood, Haiti has a tradition of collectivism, activism and military coups. Recent history has been marked by the repressive dictatorship of Francois Duvalier, 'Papa Doc.', who ruled for 14yrs until his death in 1971, backed by the dreadful 'Tonton Macoutes' paramilitary group. Former liberation theology priest Jean-Bertrand Aristide was overwhelmingly elected president in 1990, in the first democratic elections in Haitian history. Aristide was quickly overthrown by a coup, but the military junta backed down in the face of imminent U.S. military intervention; some 20,000 U.S. troops landed in September 1994, allowing Aristide's return to power. Since the U.S.-led Multi National Forces withdrew in 1995, there have been 5 UN peacekeeping missions to Haiti and the turmoil mainly affects the capital city, Port-Au-Prince. Security improves in the coastal towns and there is plenty to explore for the curious trailblazers who fancy some empty Caribbean juice.","coordinates":{"lat":19.7518,"lon":-72.0161},"iso":"ht"},{"_id":346,"_obj":"SurfArea","_path":"SurfArea","url":"\/Swahili-Coast-Surfing\/346\/","name":"Swahili Coast","countryId":0,"timezone":"","whenToGo":null,"pluses":["Semi-consistent during summer\r\n\r\n","Warm water\r\n\r\n","Virgin reefs & beachbreaks","Good hotels\r\n\r\n","Fascinating wildlife"],"minuses":["Lots of onshore mush\r\n\r\n\r\n","Mombassa sharks","Remote reefs with tidal flats"," Robberies and muggings "],"monthInfo":[{"title":"Jan","rating":0,"wetsuit":8,"waterTemperature":"26","unit":"C"},{"title":"Feb","rating":0,"wetsuit":8,"waterTemperature":"26","unit":"C"},{"title":"Mar","rating":0,"wetsuit":8,"waterTemperature":"28","unit":"C"},{"title":"Apr","rating":0,"wetsuit":8,"waterTemperature":"28","unit":"C"},{"title":"May","rating":1,"wetsuit":8,"waterTemperature":"27","unit":"C"},{"title":"Jun","rating":2,"wetsuit":8,"waterTemperature":"27","unit":"C"},{"title":"Jul","rating":2,"wetsuit":8,"waterTemperature":"25","unit":"C"},{"title":"Aug","rating":2,"wetsuit":8,"waterTemperature":"25","unit":"C"},{"title":"Sep","rating":2,"wetsuit":8,"waterTemperature":"26","unit":"C"},{"title":"Oct","rating":1,"wetsuit":8,"waterTemperature":"26","unit":"C"},{"title":"Nov","rating":0,"wetsuit":8,"waterTemperature":"27","unit":"C"},{"title":"Dec","rating":0,"wetsuit":8,"waterTemperature":"27","unit":"C"}],"description":"Kenya and Tanzania have recently unveiled a few surfing secrets along their considerable Indian Ocean coastlines.

Taiwan is only 160km (100mi) from the mainland where the government of the People's Republic of China (PRC) have ruled since winning the civil war against the Republic of China (ROC) in 1949.  The ROC government withdrew to Taiwan and continue to dispute the political rights of the PRC and maintain some sovereignty over Taiwan and the 90 small islands of Penghu (Pescadores). Despite the confusing situation, surfing in Taiwan has a long history and surf arrives from a generous 225\u00ba swell window hitting all sides of the island. US soldiers were the first to ride the north coast beach of Jin Shan in 1965 and local pioneers like Mao Guh and his brothers ignored the Taoist suspicions of the sea and government ban on access to the ocean, to take up surfing. Mao Guh opened the original and still popular Jeff's Surf Shop near Honeymoon Bay and with the lifting of Martial Law in 1987, surfing clubs popped up across the island and Jung Wen-Chen, founder of R.O.C Surfing Association, estimates that there could be 25,000 people riding waves across Taiwan. While\ncoast guard towers are more interested in illegal immigrants landing by boat, when typhoon swells hit, the main beaches will be closed and surfing is still illegal along the coast south of Hualien. A steep central mountain range means the east coast is much less developed than the overcrowded west coast, which makes Taiwan second only to Bangladesh in population density. \n\n","coordinates":{"lat":23.9612,"lon":121.609},"iso":"tw"},{"_id":354,"_obj":"SurfArea","_path":"SurfArea","url":"\/Northwest-Coast-Surfing\/354\/","name":"Northwest Coast","countryId":117,"timezone":"Australia\/Perth","whenToGo":null,"pluses":["Heaps of quality spots\r\n\r\n","World-class lefts","Mostly uncrowded","Very high consistency","Unique wildlife & diving"],"minuses":["Challenging waves\r\n\r\n","Strong wind factor","Remote break accesses","Far from Perth","Natural dangers & no hospital"],"monthInfo":[{"title":"Jan","rating":0,"wetsuit":8,"waterTemperature":"26","unit":"C"},{"title":"Feb","rating":0,"wetsuit":8,"waterTemperature":"26","unit":"C"},{"title":"Mar","rating":0,"wetsuit":8,"waterTemperature":"26","unit":"C"},{"title":"Apr","rating":1,"wetsuit":8,"waterTemperature":"26","unit":"C"},{"title":"May","rating":2,"wetsuit":8,"waterTemperature":"24","unit":"C"},{"title":"Jun","rating":2,"wetsuit":8,"waterTemperature":"24","unit":"C"},{"title":"Jul","rating":2,"wetsuit":null,"waterTemperature":"22","unit":"C"},{"title":"Aug","rating":2,"wetsuit":null,"waterTemperature":"22","unit":"C"},{"title":"Sep","rating":1,"wetsuit":null,"waterTemperature":"22","unit":"C"},{"title":"Oct","rating":1,"wetsuit":null,"waterTemperature":"22","unit":"C"},{"title":"Nov","rating":0,"wetsuit":null,"waterTemperature":"23","unit":"C"},{"title":"Dec","rating":0,"wetsuit":null,"waterTemperature":"23","unit":"C"}],"description":"Western Australia is the largest state, but it has the lowest population density of any state in Australia and maybe even the world.

The region was originally settled by Amerindian peoples (mostly Guarani and Kaingangs), while European settlement started in 1627 with Spanish Jesuits. Despite being mainly rural for much of its early history, Rio Grande do Sul has been the scene of bloody wars: the dispute between Portugal and Spain for the Sacramento Colony, and the Guarani Missions War. Large communities of German, Italian and Polish settlers entered the state from the end of the 19th century, making it racially and culturally very different from most of the other Brazilian states. Gaucho is the common denomination of the inhabitants of Rio Grande do Sul, named after the cattle herders and ranchers who settled the state's pampa regions. Nowadays, the state benefits from an attractive economy mainly based on leather, cloth goods, wine, cereals and wood and is highly regarded for it's hospitality and excellent quality of life.

First scoped by Tony Hussein in 1996, very few people have surfed Addu until recently. The Quiksilver Crossing briefly stopped there in 2003, Antony Colas scored in August 2004, meeting Welsh pilot, Andy Burr, who stayed there for a year, becoming the first 'local'. The reality is that Addu Atoll doesn't  have Maldivian standard, perfectly shaped, soft-breaking waves. Beginner\/improvers will struggle with the technical breaks that require speedy riding techniques and the sharky, shallow reefs can be intimidating.

Information about the Marshall Islands surf potential is scant, limited mainly to what expats surf seasonally on Majuro and Kwajalein atolls in the Ratak and Ralik Chain, which translates as sunrise and sunset chain. Fickle at best, the Marshalls are not one of the world's great surfing destinations, and while dreams of a Pacific version of the Maldives have crept through surfers' minds, it's far from the reality. There are a few decent waves in the Marshalls, but nothing world-class. Arno, the scenic atoll just east of Majuro, might have a wave or two if the conditions cooperate. The majority of Majuro's surfing is done around the D-U-D Municipality, which is comprised of Darrit, Uliga, and Delap, crowded villages connected by a paved road. It is a dirty place, with lots of litter, dust, ramshackle buildings, and cars. It's possible to drive along the narrow road from D-U-D all the way west to Laura, which is considerably cleaner and more typical of natural Marshallese beauty. Majuro has no honeymoon resorts, no extensive white sand beaches, and not much tourism infrastructure, yet it retains a peculiar charm in the smiles and ease of its people. Majuro atoll is the Marshalls nerve centre, home to the republic's primary government, most of its businesses, and about half of its entire population, making it one of the most densely populated atolls on Earth (31,000 people). International flights also go to Kwajalein Atoll, but it's strictly controlled by the US military, who have been testing ballistic missiles and nuclear detonations on surrounding islands, including the biggest ever explosion of a dry hydrogen bomb on Bikini Atoll in 1954.

The volcanic archipelago is made up of four islands; Grande Comoros, Anjouan and Moh\u00e9li form the independent Comoros Union, while Mayotte remains a French territory. Tourism is undeveloped thanks to political instability (18 coups in 24yrs, often led by the well-known mercenary Bob D\u00e9nard) and a lack of infrastructure. With a mix of African, Malagasy, Arab and Persian origins, it's hard to make a living for most Comorians in one of the poorest countries in the world, where poverty creates health problems like malaria and cholera. Grande Comoros, the biggest island of the archipelago and overshadowed by the 2361m (7746ft) peak of the Karthala volcano, holds a couple of low tide beachbreaks north of Moroni (Itzandra) sprinkled with a few coral heads. Also check the east coast beaches around Chomoni and the northern reefs near the salted lake. The little reef-fringed island of Moh\u00e9li has waves off Fomboni beach, but Anjouan has the best potential for the surf with a variety of waves and good exposure to the different swells. The island was in turmoil when they proclaimed independence from the Union of Comoros, but the separatists were overthrown by a military operation in early 2008. The superb tropical landscape of the island provides the perfect garden for producing ylang-ylang, a delicate yellow flower used for essential oils and fragrances.
